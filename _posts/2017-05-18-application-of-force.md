#Core Tension & Path

This illustration shows the image produced with 1000 sensors in each shoe.  The circled boxes in each foot represents the average weight distribution, also referred to as the **Center of Force**.   When you connect the **Center of Force** in each foot with a straight line, this is referred to as the **Line of Force**.

#Illustration 3
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/yiDPHTS.jpg)

In early 2004 during the initial research it was observed first that the Putter Path tracked the Line of Force. The same observation was made during the full swing by early 2005.  
 
#Illustration 4
Illustration 4 shows an outside-in path.  You can replicate this balance if you increase the knee flex in your right knee so that it is greater than your left.  Note that your weight is forward in your right foot and back in your left.  Relax your shoulders & let your arms swing without moving your shoulders.  Note the outside in path.

#Illustration 5
Illustration 5 below shows an inside-out path.  You can replicate this balance if you increase the knee flex in your left knee so that it is greater than your right.  Note that your weight is back in your right foot and forward in your left.  Relax your shoulders & let your arms swing without moving your shoulders.  Note the inside-out path.

#Tests for Core Symmetry

Each of us has **only** one of our 9 Core Regions where we have strength.  This Core Region is recruited by a Stance Width that only repeats twice in 30 inches. The tested mobility and  strength is a result of Core Symmetry when you assume a Stance Width that recruits that region of your Core.  
•	Arms Hang at your side
•	Hip Bar
•	Thumbs position for Open or Closed hip line
•	Pull on the Clubhead  Very Weak / Very Strong test
•	Close eyes & bring hands together in front
•	Lateral Motion
•	Bite Test
•	Squat Test
•	Arm Swing
•	One hand higher or lower (Obliques)
•	Shoulder, Trunk & Cervical Spine Rotation
•	Foot placement front & back prior to 360 Core
•	Foot Flare & check hip line with Blue Bar 
•	Separation of Upper & Lower Core
•	Vision Test by Stance Width Prior to Exercise

•	Ball Strength Test

#Exercises that Create Symmetry One Core Region at a Time


•	Knee, Full, Wall **Planks,** or Push-up Wall **Planks** using each of the 9 Core Region Stance Widths. (Note:  Do not **Plank** if you have any issues with Neck, Shoulder, Wrists, Elbows, Knees, or untreated Herniated Disc or similar physical issue.)  You will note that **Core Symmetry** is created in one **Core Region** at a time with the **Planking** Exercise.

#Measuring The POWER (Carrying) Angle: The Angle of Range of Motion

#Illustration 21 & 22 

The **Carrying (Power) Angle** was measured as part of the original measurements in the early 2000s biomechanics lab study as shown in the following illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/1XWtnl8.jpg) 


This illustration shows how the Power Angle was measured down the forearm 90 degrees to ground.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/spddEXn.jpg)

#Illustrations 23, 24 & 25

These illustrations show a few of the many Positions the Power Angle shows up at address and in-swing

#Posture By Core Region 

The Lower Core Player's Spine and Thigh Angle are identical

#Illustrations 26 & 27

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/gjrSdRY.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/zzxeeR1.jpg)

The **Middle Core** Players Spine Angle is greater than his Thigh Angle Angle.  The **Thigh Angle is always equal to the Power Angle** in every Core Region.  The **Middle Core** Player is the Hybrid showing setup and swing motion that is both characteristic of the Lower & Upper Core Player 

#Illustrations 28 & 29

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/8vzJILU.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/l6Ok2bu.jpg)

The **Upper Core** Player's Spine Angle is much greater than their Thigh Angle.  Again, the Thigh Angle is the same as the player's Power Angle.

#Balance by Core Region

#Illustrations 33, 34 & 35

The **Lower Core** Player is **Balanced** over the center of their arches:

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/g8d3FeJ.jpg)

The **Middle Core** Player is **Balanced** just behind the balls of their feet and just forward of the center of the arches:

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/OXxiUk5.jpg)

The **Upper Core** Player is **Balanced** over the balls of their feet:

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/GArIg6e.jpg)

How you set your **Posture** is one of the 4 variables that set the ideal balance for each of these **Core Regions**.  The other 3 variables are **Stance Width,** **Grip** & **Grip Size**


#How to Set Your Posture

From your results, as shown in the sample in **Illustration 36**, you will note that you have multiple **Stance Widths** in each **Core Region**.  You may ***use*** **all of the Stance Widths** **from your Dominant Core Region** when you play.  

#Illustration 36

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/vhvRfda.jpg)

If you want to "**Test**" your results, you may do so by listing all of the **Stance Widths by Core Region**.    List all of your **Upper Core Stance** **Widths** on one measurement tool, then all of your **Middle Core Stance** **Widths** on another measurement tool & then all of your **Lower Core Stance Widths** on a third measurement tool.

#Illustration  37

Set your **Dominant Core Region** first in your Setup.  This illustration shows setting the **Lower Core** first when in a **Lower Core Stance Width**.  Test all of the **Lower Core Stance Widths using this  Sit Down** move as the first step in setting your Posture.  Be certain to start your setup each time from a Standing Tall.  You will note that your hips remain square when you set the **Dominant Core** first by **Stance Width**. 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/ys5x9sl.jpg)

After you set your **Lower Core** first then add your **Spine Angle** as shown here in **Illustration 38**.

#Illustration 38

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/1oFaqeX.jpg)

Note that your hips remain square only if you set your posture with the Core Region that matches your Stance Width.  Your hips will open or close if you step to an **Upper** or **Middle Core Stance Width** as shown in **Illustration 39.**  Test this by placing your feet in a **Middle** or **Upper** **Core Stance Width** and then setting your **Lower Core First**.  Note that your hips will open (as shown in Illustration 39) or close when you setup in a Stance Width that does not match how you set your posture.

#Illustration 39

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/f9G4amc.jpg)
 
 **Illustrations 40** and **41** show setting the **Upper Core** first in an **Upper Core Stance Width** and then adding knee flex after the **Upper Core** is **Set**.

#Illustrations 40 & 41

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/DQMQ2W8.jpg)

Setting the **Upper Core First** is a strategy many of us learned and taught in setting **Posture**.  This Posture set only works with the **Upper Core Player** in one of their **Upper Core Stance Widths** 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/jtm7A22.jpg)


Test this **Posture** in all of the **Upper Core Stance Widths** from your results and then test it in a **Middle** or **Lower Core Stance Widths**. Notice when you set this **Posture** in a **Core Region Stance Width** other than an **Upper Core Stance Width** that your hips open or close.

**Illustration 42** shows the **Simultaneous Set** of the **Spine & Knee Flex.**  This setup only works for the **Middle Core Player** in a **Middle Core Stance Width**.  Again, test this **Stance Width** in each of the **Middle Core Stance Widths** and note that your hips remain square.  Then test the **Simultaneous Set** of your **Spine** and **Knee Flex** in an **Upper** or **Lower Core Stance Width** and note  that your hips open or close. 

#Illustration 42

This **illustration** shows the **Simultaneous Set** of **Spine** and **Knee Flex** in a **Middle Core Stance Width**.  Again, note that the hips remain square.

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/Hh8rPcK.png)


#Balance By Core Region

The **Lower Core Player's Posture** sets them over the **Center of** their **Arches**.  The **Stance Widths** labeled **"Lower Core"** in your results section recruit one of the **3 Regions** of your **Lower Core** as shown in **Illustrations 43**.  **Illustration 44** shows the ideal **Balance  Position** for the **Lower Core Player**

#Illustrations 43 & 44

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/ry3X8lI.jpg)

Use any of the **Stances Widths** from your results of your **Lower Core*.  **Set your** Lower Core **first before adding your** Spine Angle and notice that your balance is over the Center of your Arches as shown in **Illustration 44**.

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/g8d3FeJ.jpg)

#Illustration  45 & 46

The **Middle Core Player's Posture** sets them just **behind** the balls of their feet and **forward** of the **Center** of their **Arches**.  The **Stance Widths** labeled **"Middle Core"** in your results section recruit one of the **3 Regions** of your **Middle Core** as shown in **Illustrations 45**.  **Illustration 46** shows the ideal **Balance  Position** for the **Middle Core Player**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/7V3sCp9.jpg)

Use any of the **Stances Widths** from your results labeled **"Middle Core** **Stance Widths"**.  Set your **Middle Core** by adding your **Spine Angle** and **Knee Flex Simultaneously** notice that your balance is just behind the Balls of your Feet & just forward of the **Center of your Arches** as shown in **Illustration 46.**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/OXxiUk5.jpg)

#Illustration 47 & 48

The **Upper Core Player's Posture** sets them just **Over** the Balls of their feet.   The **Stance Widths** labeled **"Upper Core"** in your results section recruit one of the **3 Regions** of your **Upper Core** as shown in **Illustrations 47**.   **Illustration 48** shows the ideal **Balance  Position** for the **Upper Core Player** 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/g0ppXG8.jpg)

Use any of the **Stances Widths** from your results labeled **"Upper Core** **Stance Widths"**.  Set your **Upper Core** by adding your **Spine Angle** first and then **Knee Flex.** Notice that your balance is over the **Balls of your Feet**  as shown in **Illustration 48.**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/GArIg6e.jpg)


#Plane of the Shoulders & Grip at Top of Swing by Core Region
 
#Illustration 49

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/so0FSy5.jpg)

Note that Lower Core Player Paula Creamer has a Level Plane of her shoulders & an Under Position of her grip ; Middle Core Player Adam Scott has a "Neutral Plane" of his Shoulders & a Side-On Grip; and Upper Core Player Paul Casey has a Vertical Plane of his Shoulders and a Side-Cover Grip.  The Plane of the Shoulders and Grip at the Top of the Swing are typical for each of these Core Regions.  

#Hip Speed by Core Region & Grip (Under, Side-On, On- Top)

#Illustration 50
If you place your hands on your hips, set up in one of your **Lower Core Stance Widths**, set your **Lower Core Posture** and turn through to your finish position, 
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/g8d3FeJ.jpg)
you will notice that your motion is unimpeded and you turn easily to  your finish position.
#Illustration 51
Next, set up in one of your **Upper Core Stance Widths**, set your **Upper Core Posture** and turn through to your finish position, 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/GArIg6e.jpg)
Notice the difficulty in your rotation to finish when your **Balance** is over the **Balls of your Feet** compared to the **Lower Core Stance Width** when your **Balance** is over the **Center of your Arches**.

#Illustration 52
Lastly, set up in one of your **Middle Core Stance Widths**, set your **Middle Core Posture** and turn through to your finish position.  You will notice that the level of difficulty of rotation to your finish position was somewhere between your **Upper** & **Lower Core**.
