**Part 1** of the application of force was without a club.  It is important that    **Stance Width** and **Posture** be practiced without a club.  If you are giving a lesson and your student is struggling, the first thing to do is take the club out of their hands to check their **Stance Width** and **Posture**.  Only then do you check the grip.  If the grip checks out, then check the player's **Sequencing**.  

I would encourage you to use **Jaw Symmetry** to test each of these variables.

#**GRIP**

Now it is time to add a club.  The first thing to check in assuming a Grip is that the **heel pad of the top hand must be on top**.  Anything but an on-top heel pad is a formula for an errant shot for sure and the possibility of injury.  **Illustration 53** shows LPGA Legends Tour Player, Laurie Rinker's Grip.  Notice that her "heel pad" is on top.  Also notice that the butt of the club extends out of her hand 1 inch, another important position.  Her left thumb is in between Short and Long.

**Illustration 53**

**Illustration 54** shows Kevin Stadler's **Grip** in 20014.  Notice that his heel pad is on top but the butt of the club is in his palm.  Kevin broke a bone in his hand, likely due to the way he gripped the club.  Why would he place the club in his palm?  Our recent observations suggests that club length is probably why.  Kevin played clubs for years that were too short, thus he placed the butt of the club in his palm.

**Lower Core Power Spot**

If the **Dominant Core Region** tested in one of the **Lower Core Regions** shown in **Illustration 55**, only the **Lower Core Stance Widths** from the results you received"**MATCH**" a **Lower Core Power Spot.** 

**Illustration 55**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/ry3X8lI.jpg)

The **Power Spot** is located on the **Middle Finger** of both the left and right hands.  These **Power Spots** change by **Core Region.** 

The **Lower Core Power Spot** is on the second pad up of the middle fingers as shown in **Illustrations** **56 & 57**.  

**Illustration 56**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/c6XekqB.jpg)

**Illustration 57**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/0OfLp70.jpg)

Note the position where the butt of the club crosses the palm of the left hand.  When you place your hands on the club with these **Power Spots** on the **Bottom** of the **Grip**, you / or your students will feel "space" that is not comfortable.  "Space" is good.  That "Space" is minimized when the proper **Grip Size** is set.  We will cover Grip Size in Level 5 & 6.

If the **Dominant Core Region** tested in one of the **Middle Core Regions** shown in **Illustration 58**, only the **Middle Core Stance Widths** from the results you received"**MATCH**" a **Middle Core Power Spot.** 

**Illustration 58**

**Illustrations 59 & 60** show the grip **Power Spots** for the **Middle Core **Player's left & right hands.

If the **Dominant Core Region** tested in one of the **Upper Core Regions** shown in **Illustration 61**, only the **Upper Core Stance Widths** from the results you received"**MATCH**" a **Upper Core Power Spot.** 

**Illustration 61**

**Lower Core Thumb length and the Lower Core Power Spot**

When the left hand **Lower Core Power Spot** (**Illustration 64**) is set on the **Bottom of the Grip**, it "naturally" creates a **"Short Thumb"** as shown in **Illustration 65**.

**Illustration 64**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/c6XekqB.jpg)

**Illustration 65 - Short Thumb**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/KXFagIf.jpg)

This "**Short Thumb**" creates a "significant" **Shaft Lean** at address & a "late set" in the backswing.  Set up with a **Lower Core Power Spot**.  Note your **Short Left & Right Thumbs**.  Swing to the top and notice the late set of the club in the back swing.  The downswing will produce a release that necessitates a ball position that is center to center back.

**Upper Core Thumb length and the Upper Core Power Spot**

When the left hand **Upper Core Power Spot** (**Illustration 66**) is set on the **Bottom of the Grip**, it "naturally" creates a **"Long Thumb"** as shown in **Illustration 67.**

**Illustration 66**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/Bziv44S.jpg)

**Illustration 67** shows a **Long Thumb** in a an **Upper Core Grip**.  Note also that the heel pad is on top.  It is easy to forget about the heel pad when you are working on Power Spots.

**Illustraion 67**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/1DlTL3Y.jpg)

When you swing the club to the top with this **Long Thumb** created by the **Upper Core Power Spot,** you will note the "early set" of the club.  This early set creates a "late impact" position.  Thus the ball position is going to be forward of center.  Set up in an **Upper Core Stance Width** with the **Upper Core Power Spots** set in both the left and right hands.  Note the early set of the club in your backswing.  This "**Long Thumb**" creates a "very slight" Shaft Lean at address.


**Upper Core Thumb length and the Upper Core Power Spot**

When the left hand **Middle Core Power Spot** (**Illustration 68**) is set on the **Bottom of the Grip**, it "naturally" creates a **"Medium Thumb"** Length.  **Illustration 69** shows **Middle Core** LPGA Legends Tour Player Laurie Rinker with her left hand **Grip** set with a **Middle Core Power Spot**.

**Illustration 68**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/rktwtrC.jpg)
 
**Illustration 69**

**Shaft Lean by Core Region & Power Spot**

The **Power Spot** naturally creates a Shaft Lean that changes by **Core Region** as shown in **Illustration 70**.

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/UCMXxQL.jpg)
 
Why do we call it a **Power Spot**?  The **Power Spot** is set based upon the Player's **Power Angle**.  When the **Power Spot** is set at address, the **Power Angle** repeats at the top of the backswing as shown in **Illustration 71**.

**Illustration 71**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/TVWxQMD.jpg)

Remember, the **Power Angle** changes by **Core Region**.  It is important to measure the **Power Angle** when the player is in a **Stance Width** from their **Dominant Core Region**, **Upper, Middle or Lower**.


You will test these **Power Spots** as one way of determining the **Symmetry** of a player's setup.  Anything that compromises **Power** will show up in the downswing. It is simple to test the **Power** at the top of the swing by pushing up on the butt of the club as shown in **Illustration 72**.

**Illustration 72**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/ghUlcA9.jpg)

Note in **Illustration 72** that **Power** is demonstrated in the downswing.  If you change **Stance Width**, the **Power Spot** or **Sequencing** of motion by **Core Region**, you will see and feel a "**Power Leak**" as shown in **Illustration 73**.

**Illustration 73**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/7RJjbiy.jpg)

Where do the **Power Spots** come from?  The **Power Spots** come from years of research into the **Power Angle**.  We know that the **Power Angle** shows up in numerous positions at address and repeats throughout the swing.  We also know that the **Power Spots** only create **Power** when they are set by **Core Region**.  There is a simple "**Test**" you can do to check the **Power Spot** shown in **Illustrations 74 & 75**.

Set up with the **Stance Widths** from any of the **Core Regions** in your results page.  Set the corresponding **Power Spot** that matches the **Stance Width** you assume.  (This is also another way to validate your measurements as you did with the **Posture** exercise.)  Set the club under your heel pad and on the **Middle Finger Power Spot**on the **Bottom** of the **Grip**.  Be certain the club is supported only in the **Middle Finger** and the heel pad as it rest in the **Power Spot** on the Bottom of the **Grip** that "**Matches**" the **Core Region Stance Width** you are in.

You will note that when the **Power Spot Matches** your **Core Region Stance Width** that you can support the club parallel to the Ground as shown in **Illustration 74.**   Test each **Stance Width** of that **Core Region** and you will note that your are able to **Balance** the club and it remains parallel to the ground. 

**Illustration 74**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/kiBVKym.jpg)

If you change your **Stance Width** to a **Core Region** that doesn't **Match** your **Power Spot** or if you change **Power Spots**, you will note that you lose the ability to **Balance** the club and it drops below parallel as shown in **Illustration 75.**

**Illustration 75**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/TgAYszp.jpg)

Another simple way to **Test** your **Power Spots** vs **Stance Widths** is to Stand in a **Dominant Core Stance Width**.  **Grip** the club with the **Matching Power Spots** set and the shaft vertical as shown in **Illustration 76**.  

**Illustration 76**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/x534Qih.jpg)

When the **Power Spots** are set to **Match** the **Core Region** of your **Stance Width**, You will have full **Range of motion (ROM)** as you rotate your shoulders back & through.  This freedom of **ROM** left and right is shown in **Illustrations 77 & 78**. 

**Illustration 77**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/0C2yK8R.jpg)

**Illustration 78**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/Am1ntRI.jpg)

When you change either your **Stance Width** to another **Core Region** or change one **Power Spot**, when you attempt to rotate you will have limited **ROM** in one or both directions as shown in **Illustration 79**.

**Illustration 79**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/h3m3kOg.jpg)

Our research showed that when the Power Spot or Stance Width changed, the player's hips opened or closed.  This phenomena is shown in Illustration 80 during the Pilot Study on Power Spots.

**Illustration 80**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/TBpouQF.jpg) 

Note the changes on the **Balance Mat** where my hips rotate left (open).  These changes in the hip line occur with a **Power Spot** that doesn't match the **Stance Width** or a **Power Spot** that isn't properly set on the  **Bottom** of the **Grip**.

**Illustration 81** shows a player with the hip bar on standing tall and a square hip line.

**Illustration 81**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/ePjviG5.jpg)

When this player assumes his Grip Power Spots that fit his Core Region Stance Width and sets his posture, his hips remain Square. 
 
**Illustration 81** 
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/qQK8MEQ.jpg) 

When he takes his right hand off the club, the middle of his right hand lines up to cover his left thumb.  His **Power Spots, Posture** and **Stance Width** combine to create a **Neutral Shaft Plane.**

When he changes one **Power Spot** in either hand, his hips rotate right (closed) and his **Shaft Plane Lowers** as shown in **Illustration 82**.

**Illustration 82**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/sizxfIh.jpg)

When the **Shaft Plane** and **Shaft Lean** is set by the correct **Grip Power Spots** (including heel pad on top) , the **Stance Width** & **Posture** set **Matches** the **Core Region** & the **Stance** is square to the **Target Line**, the clubface aim will be aimed precisely at the Target as shown in **Illustration 83**.

**Illustration 83**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/cTKmaJ0.jpg)

This same process applies to the **Putter**.  **Stance Width**, **Posture**, **Power Spots** will impact **Putter Face Aim** & **Path**.  **Matching** by **Core Region**, **Stance Width**, **Grip Power Spots** & **Posture** will create a perfectly aimed **Putter** as Shown in **Illustration 84**. 

**Illustration 84**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/njkQjYN.jpg)

If you set up with a **Putter** or Iron and take your trail hand off the club & your trail hand does not line up, you have one or more set up fundamentals that do not **Match**.   **Illustrations 85 and 86** demonstrate how to check Putter and Irons using your trail hand.  If your trail hand does not demonstrate a **Neutral Shaft Plane**, **Aim & Path** will be off.

**Illustration 85**

#**Sequencing of Motion**

**The Sequencing of Motion Changes by Core Region.**  

If the **Stance Width** matches the **Core Region**; if the **Power Spots** are set correctly on the **Bottom of the Grip** and if the **Grip** was assumed at the proper time, the player is set to **Apply Maximum Force**.  If one of these set up **Fundamentals** does not **Match**, the **Core Region**  **Motion Sequencing** and **Power** will be compromised.  Clubface aim will be offline & the ability to **Apply Maximum Force** is also compromised.  When the player sets up without **Matching Fundamentals** they will swing with multiple compensations and their potential for injury rises.

The mechanics advantage of **Tour Players** is that they have **Matching Fundamentals**.  The goal of the coach is to be certain that these fundamentals are maintained at address & through the swing.  The other advantage **Tour players** have is their emphasis on **Core Conditioning**.  With a comprehensive **Core Training Program**, Core Symmetry is easier to find at address. 

**Illustration 87** shows the address positions of the **Lower, Upper & Middle Core Players.**

**Illustration 87**
 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/UCMXxQL.jpg)


**Illustration 88** shows the beginning of their backswings.

**Illustration 88**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/vPczoGh.jpg)

 Note that **Lower Core Player** **Dustin Johnson** starts the club to the top of the backswing with only his **Upper Core**.  **Middle Core Player Ernie Els** starts the club in his backswing and begins to release his hips when the club is at a 45 degree angle in his backswing.  **Upper Core Player** **Patrick Reed** begins his swing with both his **Upper & Lower Core**.
   
**Illustration 89** shows these same players at the top of their backswing.  Note that the **Center of Mass (COM)** at the top of the swing varies by **Core Region**.

**Illustration 89**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/G68eqTk.jpg)

**Lower Core Player Dustin Johnson's COM** is right at the top of his swing.  Also note the amount of hip restriction characteristic of the **Lower Core** Player.  **Middle Core Player Ernie Els' COM** is centered at the top of his swing.  Note **Ernie Els'** hip turn at the top.  The down the line (DTL) view in **Illustration 90** shows the top of the Swing.  You can see the amount of hip turn in each Core Region.

**Illustration 90**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/OywdVwm.jpg)

**Illustration 91** shows the top of the swing for **Lower Core Player Paula Creamer**, **Middle Core Player Adam Scott** and **Upper Core Player Paul Casey.**

 **Illustration 91**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/TKhS3ti.jpg)

Note the level plane of **Paula Creamer's** shoulders and her **Under Grip** position at the top, as also noted in **Dustin Johnson**.  The amount of hip turn by Core Region is apparent by Core Region.     

Note the similarities of **Lower Core Players Johnson & Creamer,  Middle Core Players Els & Scott & Upper Core Players Reed & Casey**.  These swings are covered in detail in our other EBooks.  The constants of the **Matching Fundamentals** are important as they define the **Stance Widths**, **Posture, Power Spots** & **Swing Sequencing**for each **Core Region.**

When the **Upper Core Player** has **Matching Fundamentals** at address they initiate their swing with **Both** the **Upper** & **Lower Core** starting the backswing together;  the **Lower Core Player** starts their swing motion with their  **Upper Core Only** and the **Middle Core Player** starts their swing with their **Upper Core** and then release their hips prior to the club  reaching parallel to the ground.  These **Swing Sequences** are shown in **Illustration 92**.



**Illustration 92**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/vPczoGh.jpg)

When the **Upper Core** **Player** starts their backswing with their arms and hands out pacing the **Lower Core**, there is a loss of **Core Symmetry**, the hips open or close and the swing path changes.

The easiest way to check **Symmetry** is for the student to test their **Jaw Symmetry** at each phase of **Stance Width**, **Grip**, **Posture** and the **Backswing** in phases.  **Jaw Symmetry** identification requires training at each phase of measurement and exercise.  Our research shows that **Jaw Symmetry** can be used when the **Core 360 Exercise Program** is done.   The **Jaw Symmetry** test should be reserved until the 4th or 5th lesson and only with the more serious player who is also doing the **Core 360 Exercise Program**. 

#**When to Place Your Hands on the Club**
 
When you place your hands on the club, you engage your **Core**.  If, when you place your hands on the club your hips are closed or open (as shown in **Illustration 93**) your hips will be exactly as they were when you gripped the club.
**Illustration 93**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/iPwo070.jpg)

The outcome of gripping the club when you have an open or closed hip line results in the same position as shown in **Illustration 94**.  

**Illustration 94**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/epbAuT0.jpg)

When you grip the club after setting your **Stance Width**  your hips will be square at address as shown in **Illustrations 95 & 96**. 
**Illustration 95**

#**Setting Connection at Address**

Watch your student hit balls before adding connection at address.  If their **Sequencing** fits their **Core Region Stance Width**, etc., I would hold off on teaching connection.  **Connection** is totally dependent upon club length & the players ability to place their hands on the club correctly.   **Connection** will elevate consistency of impact. **Connection** is sets a perfect shaft plane and the correct distance from the ball.

Reserve **Connection** for a time when you know your student has their grip set perfectly each time.  Perfectly means that they consistently are in the correct **Stance Widt**h, they set the butt of the club under the heel pad and their **Power Spot** is set at address.

If  **Connection** is set at address with a club that is too short  (**Illustration 97**), the club will either be set in the palm, as you saw with Kevin Stadler, (**Illustration 98**) or their will be too much spine tilt at address.  

**Illustration 97** shows Jai, a **Lower Core Player**, set up with a wedge that is too short.  The club is 2 plus inches from the floor.   If he grounds the club, he will experience too much forward spine angle and his **ROM** will be restricted. 

**Illustration 97**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/yaaMADf.jpg)

Note Kevin Stadler's **Grip** in his palm in photo **Illustration 98** below, also a club that is too short.

**Illustration 98**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/iqvriTg.jpg)

The **Power Angle** is used to set connection.  **Grip** the club in your left hand with the butt of the club under the heel pad and the **Power Spot** set on the underside of  the **Grip**.  Allow the **Grip** to hang in front with the elbows resting on the chest wall in a natural position.  Use the digital protractor to be certain the **Power Angle** is set as shown in **Illustration 98**.

**Illustration 98**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/b7Ble8R.jpg)

Add the right hand, again with the arm off the chest wall and also at the Power Angle as shown in **Illustration 99**. 

**Illustration 99**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/WsrPsgn.jpg)
 
Note that Jai's **Power Angle** is 158.5 degrees.  

**LPGA Legends** tour Player, Anne Marie Palli's **Power Angle** is shown in **Illustration 100**.  Anne Marie's **Power Angle** is 152 degrees.  Note her connection and the angle of the shaft at address as she prepares to ground the club.

**Illustration 100**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/tERYeJm.jpg)

In **Illustration 101**, Anne Marie grounds the club maintaining her angles of connection as she grounds the club.

**Illustration 101**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/O0398H5.jpg) 

**Connection** at address ensures that the first move maintains connection of the Upper Core.

#**Complementary Grip**
The **Complementary Grip** is based upon the strength and weakness of the left and right hands on the club.  There is no relationship between the **Power Spots** and a **Complementary Grip**.  They are equally important and both will open or close the hip line.  However, when the grip is neutral, one sets the **Shaft Plane**(**Power Spots**) and the other impacts **Range of Motion**  They both are related to the **Power Angle**.

The **Complementary Grip** is set as shown in **Illustration 102** & **Illustration 103**.  This grip only works when you have done the **WB Core 360 Exercise Program**.  Be certain your student has done their **WB Core 360 Exercise Program** when you are setting your **Complementary Grip**.

 **Illustration 102**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/kjJwR9c.jpg)

When you extend your hands in front, palms together, you will note that your hips open or close.  When you rotate your palms to your **Power Angle** as shown in **Illustration 103**, you will have maximum rotation in your backswing as shown in **Illustration 104**.

**Illustration 103**

**Illustration 104**
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/86iICGM.jpg)




There are 3 types of **Complementary Grips**.  The **Complementary Grip** most of us has taught for years has a strong left hand and a weak right hand.  Venezuelan**Wright Balance Professional**, Pedro Ruggeri refers to this traditional grip as the "Butterfly Grip".   This grip is  the ideal grip in about 10% of players.

The **Wright Balance Grip Trainer** (**Illustration 105**) was developed specifically to train a **Complementary Grip** at home off the course & practice range.  The goal is to have the student train throughout the day during idle time.  With repeated practice using the trainer, the student will have a will trained Complementary grip.

**Illustration 105**

#**Grip Size** 

**Golf** grips are measured in inches. One (1) mil is equal to 1/1000 inch... 900 to 915 mils is the golf industry installed standard grip size for the top hand of a club, 850 mils is the installed standard of an undersized grip, 960 is the measured top hand size of an installed midsize grip and 1020 is the installed industry standard of an oversized grip. 

It is important to remember that the industry standard is measured 2 inches down the shaft from the base of the grip cap. Wright BalanceÂ® grip size measurement standards are measured to the middle finger of the left hand on irons and woods and the middle finger of both hands on the putter. I recently had a student with short fingers and very wide palms. His grips were measured 4.25 inches down the shaft. 

**Why is this important?** Some players grip down on the club. Brooke Henderson and Anthony Kim grip down on the club.  They were finding their ideal grip size. The grip has a natural taper of about 50 to 70 mils from the left to right hand. Palm width, position of a players hands on the club and the natural taper of the grip are reasons we measure to the middle finger of the left hand on irons and woods and the middle finger of both hands on the putter. Please keep these factors in mind.

**Grip Size** changes heel to toe balance.  A **Grip** that is too small will move the player forward as shown in **Illustrations 106, 107, & 108** & in the process, sacrifice the Application of Force.

**Illustration 106**  (Lower Core Grip too small)

  **Illustration 108**  (Upper Core Grip too small)
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/94yGWi7.jpg)

A Grip that is too big will move the player back toward their heels from their ideal balance position as shown in **Illustrations 108, 109, & 110** & in the process, sacrifice the **Application of Force**.

The **Grip Sizing** process changes by **Core Region**.  **Test** **Grip Size** in 100 mil increments.  For example, if your student measures 1165, you may test at 1065 mils, 965 mils or 865 mils.  the original measurement is outside industry standards unless you are using Jumbo Max Grips.  I would test within industry standards first.  Test each size by having your student take the club to the top of their backswing and push up on the butt of the club as shown in **Illustration 111**.  One of the 2 to 3 sizes will test stronger than the other(s).  Sizing information will be available in another EBook.
