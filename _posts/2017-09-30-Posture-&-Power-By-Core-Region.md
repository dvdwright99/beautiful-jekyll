The **Middle Core** Players Spine Angle is greater than his Thigh Angle Angle.  The **Thigh Angle is always equal to the Power Angle** in every Core Region.  The **Middle Core** Player is the Hybrid showing setup and swing motion that is both characteristic of the Lower & Upper Core Player

The **Upper Core** Player's Spine Angle is much greater than their Thigh Angle.  Again, the Thigh Angle is the same as the player's Power Angle.

#**How to Set Your Posture**

From your results, as shown in the sample in, you will note that you have multiple **Stance Widths** in each **Core Region**.  You may ***use*** **all of the Stance Widths** **from your Dominant Core Region** when you play.

If you want to "**Test**" your results, you may do so by listing all of the **Stance Widths by Core Region**.    List all of your **Upper Core Stance** **Widths** on one measurement tool, then all of your **Middle Core Stance** **Widths** on another measurement tool & then all of your **Lower Core Stance Widths** on a third measurement tool.


#**Balance by Core Region**

 After viewing the video above and validating your results by how you set your posture, note where your weight is in your feet by Core Region.

The **Lower Core** Player is **Balanced** over the center of their arches:

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/g8d3FeJ.jpg)

The **Middle Core** Player is **Balanced** just behind the balls of their feet and just forward of the center of the arches:

The **Upper Core** Player is **Balanced** over the balls of their feet:

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/GArIg6e.jpg)

How you set your **Posture** is one of the 4 variables that set the ideal balance for each of these **Core Regions**.  The other 3 variables are **Stance Width,** **Grip** & **Grip Size**


#**How to Set Your Posture**

From your results, you will note that you have multiple **Stance Widths** in each **Core Region**.  You may ***use*** **all of the Stance Widths** **from your Dominant Core Region** when you play.

If you want to "**Test**" your results, you may do so by listing all of the **Stance Widths by Core Region**.    List all of your **Upper Core Stance** **Widths** on one measurement tool, then all of your **Middle Core Stance** **Widths** on another measurement tool & then all of your **Lower Core Stance Widths** on a third measurement tool.

 This video is a demonstration of how you can validate your results, regardless what your dominant Core Region is, by how you set your posture.  Please view this video in detail and then test your results by listing your Stance Widths by Core Region using the Stance Widths you were emailed after completing your body measurements.

To review, set your **Dominant Core Region** first in your Setup.  This illustration shows setting the **Lower Core** first when in a **Lower Core Stance Width**.  Test all of the **Lower Core Stance Widths using this  Sit Down** move as the first step in setting your Posture.  Be certain to start your setup each time from a Standing Tall.  You will note that your hips remain square when you set the **Dominant Core** first by **Stance Width**.

After you set your **Lower Core** first add your **Spine Angle** as shown here.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/1oFaqeX.jpg)

Note that your hips remain square only if you set your posture with the Core Region that matches your Stance Width.  Your hips will open or close if you step to an **Upper** or **Middle Core Stance Width** as shown in **Illustration 39.**  Test this by placing your feet in a **Middle** or **Upper** **Core Stance Width** and then setting your **Lower Core First**.  Note that your hips will open (as shown in Illustration 39) or close when you setup in a Stance Width that does not match how you set your posture.

 The following illustrations show setting the **Upper Core** first in an **Upper Core Stance Width** and then adding knee flex after the **Upper Core** is **Set**.

Setting the **Upper Core First** is a strategy many of us learned and taught in setting **Posture**.  This Posture set only works with the **Upper Core Player** in one of their **Upper Core Stance Widths** 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/jtm7A22.jpg)

Test this **Posture** in all of the **Upper Core Stance Widths** from your results and then test it in **Middle** or **Lower Core Stance Widths**. Notice when you set this **Posture** in a **Core Region Stance Width** other than an **Upper Core Stance Width** that your hips open or close.

The Middle Core player uses a **Simultaneous Set** of the **Spine & Knee Flex.**  This setup only works for the **Middle Core Player** in a **Middle Core Stance Width**.  Again, test this **Stance Width** in each of the **Middle Core Stance Widths** and note that your hips remain square.  Then test the **Simultaneous Set** of your **Spine** and **Knee Flex** in an **Upper** or **Lower Core Stance Width** and note  that your hips open or close. 
 
This **illustration** shows the **Simultaneous Set** of **Spine** and **Knee Flex** in a **Middle Core Stance Width**.  Again, note that your hips remain square.

#**Balance By Core Region**

The **Lower Core Player's Posture** sets them over the **Center of** their **Arches**.  The **Stance Widths** labeled **"Lower Core"** in your results section recruit one of the **3 Regions** of your **Lower Core** as shown in **Illustrations 43**.  **Illustration 44** shows the ideal **Balance  Position** for the **Lower Core Player**


![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/ry3X8lI.jpg)

Use any of the **Stances Widths** from your results of your **Lower Core*.  **Set your** Lower Core **first before adding your** Spine Angle and notice that your balance is over the Center of your Arches as shown in **Illustration 44**.

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/g8d3FeJ.jpg)

The **Middle Core Player's Posture** sets them just **behind** the balls of their feet and **forward** of the **Center** of their **Arches**.  The **Stance Widths** labeled **"Middle Core"** in your results section recruit one of the **3 Regions** of your **Middle Core** as shown in **Illustrations 45**.  **Illustration 46** shows the ideal **Balance  Position** for the **Middle Core Player**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/7V3sCp9.jpg)

Use any of the **Stances Widths** from your results labeled **"Middle Core** **Stance Widths"**.  Set your **Middle Core** by adding your **Spine Angle** and **Knee Flex Simultaneously** notice that your balance is just behind the Balls of your Feet & just forward of the **Center of your Arches** as shown in **Illustration 46.**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/OXxiUk5.jpg)


The **Upper Core Player's Posture** sets them just **Over** the Balls of their feet.   The **Stance Widths** labeled **"Upper Core"** in your results section recruit one of the **3 Regions** of your **Upper Core** as shown in **Illustrations 47**.   **Illustration 48** shows the ideal **Balance  Position** for the **Upper Core Player** 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/g0ppXG8.jpg)

Use any of the **Stances Widths** from your results labeled **"Upper Core** **Stance Widths"**.  Set your **Upper Core** by adding your **Spine Angle** first and then **Knee Flex.** Notice that your balance is over the **Balls of your Feet**  as shown in this illustration.

#**Plane of the Shoulders & Trail Arm / Hand at the Top of the Swing by Core Region**
 
 
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/so0FSy5.jpg)

Note that Lower Core Player Paula Creamer has a Level Plane of her shoulders & an Under Position of her grip ; Middle Core Player Adam Scott has a "Neutral Plane" of his Shoulders & a Side-On Grip; and Upper Core Player Paul Casey has a Vertical Plane of his Shoulders and a Side-Cover Grip.  The Plane of the Shoulders and Grip at the Top of the Swing are typical for each of these Core Regions.  

 #Ground Reaction Force 

The latest in understanding **Power** in the Golf Swing is **Ground Reaction Force**



 If you place your hands on your hips, set up in one of your **Lower Core Stance Widths**, set your **Lower Core Posture** and turn through to your finish position, 
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/g8d3FeJ.jpg)
you will notice that your motion is unrestricted and you turn easily to  your finish position.

**Lower Core GRF**  The power recruited from the ground in the motion of the Lower Core player is  

Next, set up in one of your **Upper Core Stance Widths**, set your **Upper Core Posture** and turn through to your finish position. 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/GArIg6e.jpg)
Notice the difficulty in your rotation to finish when your **Balance** is over the **Balls of your Feet** compared to the **Lower Core Stance Width** when your **Balance** is over the **Center of your Arches**.  You will notice that your tendency is to "Rise" and your heels come off the ground as you turn through.  This is an example of the "Vertical Ground Force" used by the Upper Core Player

Lastly, set up in one of your **Middle Core Stance Widths**, set your **Middle Core Posture** and turn through to your finish position.  You will notice that the level of difficulty of rotation to your finish position was somewhere between your **Upper** & **Lower Core**.
