**Use  only the first 3 Stance Widths in Bold Type to Set Up the Diagnostic for Dominant Core Region and the 9 Stance Widths for the Core 360 Exercise Program**   


 
 ![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/gkkWcGh.jpg)

 

Now, look at the **First Stance Width** in the **Lower Core Results**.   That **Stance Width** is **Number 1** and recruits the lowest part of the Core, the pelvic floor.  Note that the Lower Core is Color coded Blue.  **If** the first Stance Width in the **Lower Core Results** is **28 inches**, mark the yardstick **Blue # 1** at the **28 inch** mark as shown in this illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/s4R65R0.jpg) 

The number 2 means that **Stance Width** **Recruits** the **Region** of the **Core** exactly between the **Navel** and the Pelvic Floor as shown in this illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/yUXAliH.jpg)

**If** the **Second Stance Width** in the **Lower Core Results** is **12 inches**, mark the yardstick with a **Blue** pen at the **12 inch mark** and write the **number 2** above the **12 inch mark** as shown in the following illustration.  

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/tMrqLUc.jpg)

**If** the **Third Stance Width** in the **Lower Core Results** is **23 inches**, mark the yardstick with a **Blue** marker at the **23** inch mark and put the **number 3** **above** the **23 inch** mark as shown in the following illustration.  The **number 3** means that **Stance Width** **Recruits** the **Region** of the **Core** just below the **Navel**.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/s4R65R0.jpg)



![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/jBG0W7k.jpg)
 
You are going to use a **Black Marker** for the **Middle Core** Stance Widths for the **first 3 numbers** of the **Middle Core Results** you are emailed.  The **first Stance Width** will be **numbered 4**, the **second numbered 5** & and the **third Stance Width** **numbered 6****.   Note the corresponding numbered Regions of the Core.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/OB6Beoq.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/s4R65R0.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/tMrqLUc.jpg)

The **Upper Core Results** should be recorded on the yardstick using a **Red Marker**.  The first **3 Stance Widths** of the **Upper Core Results** recruit the **3** **Regions** of the **Upper Core**.  

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/P3vntkd.jpg)

You will take the first Stance Width of the Upper Core Results and number it **7**, the second Stance Width and number it **8** and the third Stance Width from your Upper Core results and number it **9**.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/tMrqLUc.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/s4R65R0.jpg)


Transfer the first 3 Stance Widths [shown in **Bold Type** in the results] from each Core Region (Lower, Middle & Upper-- 9 Total) to a measurement tool you will use to "test" and  determine the **Dominant Core Region**. 

#**Review: How to Use the Results to Mark a Yardstick **

Color Code the Stance Widths by Core Region with:

**Blue = The first 3 Stance Widths listed in the Lower Core Results.  Number those Stance Widths Regions 1, 2 & 3 respectively.**
 
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/yUXAliH.jpg)

**Black= Middle Core Stance Widths (Regions 4, 5 & 6)**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/OB6Beoq.jpg)

**Red=  Upper Core Stance Widths  (Regions 7, 8 & 9)**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/P3vntkd.jpg)

 
Note the Color Coding and Numbering on the Paper Yardstick in the following illustration.  The Color Coding and Numbering are Universal for Wright Balance Professionals.  It will also help your student and you determine their Dominant Core Region during the testing.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/DGvShxL.jpg)

You have 5 to 9 Stance Widths your student can play from once you determine the Core Region, Grip, Posture and Power Spots.

Return to the original results and find their playing Core Region.
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/gkkWcGh.jpg) 

I would encourage you to use an alignment Stick to set up their Stance Widths for practice.

Power is recruited from the Ground by Core Region.  Neurologist and Wright Balance Professional Dr. Robert Giombetti (pictured below) conducted a study with 60 Lower, Middle and Upper Core Players. 

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/fG2bDHy.jpg)


Dr. Giombetti used the Wright Balance System to set Stance Width, Posture & Power Spots.  He used a Swing Catalyst & a TrackMan Launch Monitor.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/vww02BW.jpg)

Below is Wright Balance Professional and LPGA Legends Tour Player Laurie Rinker on the Swing Catalyst in Dr. Giombetti's lab.![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/AZHAkgB.jpg)
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/vLw08kH.jpg)

The easiest way to look at Ground Reaction Force (GRF) is 
"Glide", "Spin" & "Launch" as shown in the Illustration below.
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/Qx7FWKI.jpg)

 Dr. Giombetti's research showed defined patterns of the use of the Ground by Core Region.  The Lower Core Player uses "Glide" & "Spin" as shown in this illustration taken from a sample of Dr. Giombetti's research results.
 ![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/P48f312.jpg)
The Middle Core Player's research results showed Ground Use Peaks in all 3 measures ("Glide", "Spin" & "Launch") as shown in the Following illustration.  Note that some Middle Core players (Justin Thomas) will use "Launch" more than others.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/klIk50n.jpg)

Dr. Giombetti's results for the Upper Core Player show use of the ground via "Spin" and "Launch" with very little if any "Glide" as shown in the following illustration.
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/LoqbPxy.jpg)

Lower Core players who are trying to "Launch" are working against their natural recruitment of Power from the Ground, "Glide" & "Spin".

Follow the examples below & you will begin to understand how Grip plays a role in use of the ground.

Set your Arm Like Jai's is in this photo.  Close your eyes and note where your weight goes heel to toe when you hold this position.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/MndasRZ.jpg)

Again note where your weight goes heel to toe.  If you have done the Core 360 Exercise, you will notice that your weight moves toward the balls of your feet.

Now, holding that Right Arm hand position, rotate in a backswing to the top.  Notice your Center of Mass (COM) is left at the top.
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/wcr5tMa.jpg)

Notice that your weight is forward on the balls of your feet.  As you turn through to impact, you will note that you "rise" or "Launch" in order to turn through to the finish.   

Next, tuck your trail arm elbow as close to your navel as possible.  You will note that some of you have a limited ability in setting this position and others have no problem at all.  Notice that your weight is over the Center of your arches.  The more you tuck your elbow, the more "back" you will feel in your balance.

 Lower Core Player Dustin Johnson at address with a "Strong" Grip setting he stag
 
 Hold that position and rotate to the top.  Note that your COM is over your back leg at the top.
