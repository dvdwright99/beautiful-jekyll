#Grip Size Summary:  
------------------



**After almost 30 years of research into grip size we know the following:**
> 1.   Grip Size changes by Core Region Putter through Driver 
2. Grip size changes heel to toe Balance
3. The size of the grip allows you to test by 100 mil increments within your Dominant Core Region & usually within industry standards.   
4. Three Simple hand measurements yield grip size when input on the Wright Balance site
5. When Lower & Upper Core players have exactly the same hand size, the Lower Core Player will play a larger Grip than the Upper Core Player 
6. When players test the range of 3 different sizes that fit their Dominant Core Region, they will experience changes in heel to toe balance.  Each of those sizes will square the hip line.  However, only one of those 3 sizes will test for maximum Power.   
 
##Why is Grip Size Important?

Everything we do while holding or gripping something  to swinging a club, racquet or bat, walking with a cane or walker requires balance.  Our Wright Balance® research shows that grip and hand size can either support balance or create imbalance.

When you place something in your left and/or your right hand that does not fit your hand size, the improper size creates tension on one side of your core muscles, depending on Stance Width, and compromises balance.  This core tension causes your hips to rotate left or right to an “open” or “closed” position creating imbalance. This includes anything from a golf club, putter, bat, tennis racquet, rake, broom, shovel or even a cane.   Grip Sizing has numerous applications, I am going focus only on Golf in this overview.

##Grip Size Measurements

What is a “mil”?

Golf grips are measured in inches. One (1) mil is equal to 1/1000 inch.  The Golf industry has established the following Standards:
>1.  Grip Size is measured for the Left hand only, 2 inches down from the top ring of the Butt Cap of the Golf Grip for irons & 2 inches down from the top for the Putter.
2.  An installed "Standard" Size grip measures 900 to 915 mils 
3. An installed "Undersized" Grip measures 850-70 mils
4. An installed Midsize Grip measures 960 mils
5. An installed "Jumbo" or "Oversized" Grip measures 1020 mils.
**NOTE**:  When considering these measures, please know that the size is taken 2 inches down from the top ring of the Butt Cap of the Club  
 
Wright Balance® grip size standards are measured to the middle finger of the left hand on irons and woods and the middle finger of both hands on the putter.

**Insert Photo of showing where to measure**

Why is this important?  Some players grip down on the club.  The grip has a natural taper of about 50 to 70 mils from the left to right hand. Palm width, position of a player's hands on the club and the natural taper of the grip are reasons we measure to the middle finger of the left hand on irons and woods and the middle finger of both hands on the putter.  Please keep these factors in mind as you read this overview. 
  
##Grip Size vs Hand Size

Bigger is not better.  Fitting your left hand for your irons and woods and your right and left hands for putter to the proper sizes is the goal.  A grip that fits your hand size sets your ideal heel to toe Balance, minimizes the stress in your core muscles, squares your hip line, facilitates maximum separation of the Upper & Lower Core in the swing and creates a balanced set up to the ball.   

There is a belief among students of the game that if you want to take your hands out of your swing, you should use bigger grips; if you want to use more hands in your game, get smaller grips.  If you are an Upper Core Player, you want to use your arms and hands.  If you are a Lower Core Player, you want to use more body.  An Upper Core Player's release is of the arms and hands.  The Lower Core Players release is of the body.  

Just because someone is tall and wide does not mean their hand size is large.  I have a senior tour player who is 6 feet 2 inches who uses an undersized grip.  Standard grips are too big for him.  Two time Masters winner Bubba Watson uses 12 extra wraps of tape under his right hand and 10 extra under his left (he is left-handed.)  US Open Winner Retief Goosen plays an oversize grip with 7 extra wraps.  

One of my students, PGA Tour Winner and former Long Drive Champion, Dennis Paulson uses a standard left hand grip size.  He put 6 extra wraps under his right hand (his hand size on our laser hand scanner measured size 880 mils for his left hand and 876 mils for his right, precisely 6 extra wraps under his right hand).  Dennis intuitively found his correct size during his early years on tour.  He experimented with different grip sizes until he found the one that felt best to him.  

Another of my students, seven year PGA Tour veteran, Pat Burke measured 932 mils left hand and 873 right hand (also measured on our laser hand scanner.)  Pat had a career ending wrist injury in 1997 that he attributes to playing the incorrect grip sizes.  

Ask your Wright Balance® Professional about your left hand size and the alternatives you have for sizing.  If you have very large hands, there is a sizing adjustment to maintain Core Balance and move you to a size that will minimize swing weight changes and allow you to play a grip size in one of the industry standard grips.      

**How to Check Your Current Grip Size**

Assume the Stance Width you were provided by your Wright Balance® Professional for your irons.   If you have been shown the Wright Balance® Grip (Power Spot placement of your hands & Complimentary Grip on the club) by your Wright Balance® Professional, don’t use that grip for this test.  

[**Note**: We will use the Power Spots and Complimentary Grip in the next phase of testing.  That phase of testing is important as it demonstrates the significance of the Wright Balance® Grip in Power, Freedom of Motion, Shaft Lean & Shaft Plane and Solid Contact.  Eliminating those factors for this part of the test allows you to experience the impact of Grip Size]

Without the Wright Balance® Grip (Placement of your hands on the Club) 
Take your 6 or 7 iron and assume your set up with knee flex (bend.) Be certain to assume a Stance Width from your Dominant Core Region.   

Now set up with your club.  If your right knee flex is greater than your left, note that your weight loads to your right side and your hips rotate to your left (open).  Your weight distribution will be similar to the illustration below.
 
**Insert Photo Illustration Here**

Your weight will load more to your right side, forward in your right foot and back in your left. 

 If your left knee flex is greater, note that your weight loads to your left side and your hips rotate to your right (closed).  your weight distribution will be similar to the following illustration.

**Insert Photo Illustration Here**
   
If your club fits your hands, you will feel centered and the amount of left and right knee flex will be identical.  
 
Stay in your posture once you grip the club, open your hands and let the club drop to the ground, relax your shoulders and let your arms hang without a club in your hands.  Make a firm fist with each hand, close your eyes and point your thumbs toward each other at your mid-line as shown in this Illustration.  

**Insert Photo Illustration Here**

From this shoulders, arms and hands relaxed position, open your eyes and note where your hands hang.  If you your left hand is closer to your body (left thigh) than your right, your hips are open.  If your right hand is closer to your body your (right thigh) your hips are closed.

**[NOTE**:  If you are not in a Stance Width from your Dominant Core Region provided by your Wright Balance® Professional, these tests will not be accurate or at all helpful to you.  Grip size is fit to your Dominant Core Region.  A Grip Size that fits your Upper Core Stance Widths will not fit your Middle Core Stance Widths.**]**

If your left hand is closer to your body than your right, you will notice that your weight is slightly forward in your right foot and slightly back in your left.  That is an outside–in balance path.  You will note that the results are just the opposite if your right hand is closer to your body when you check after dropping the club.

Next let your arms swing.  Note that your arm swing path is along your hip line, outside-in (away from you in the backswing and back toward you and behind you in the thru swing), inside- out (toward and behind you in the backswing and away from you in the through swing), or straight back and straight thru.

**Note:**  An open hip line will restrict your backswing, create a steep angle in your downswing and an over the top swing (outside-in) with large right to left divots.  Your miss will be a pull left or a block right.  A closed hip line will often result in lateral motion (unless you remain on the left side address position through the swing) an over-swing and a restriction in your downswing causing overactive hands through the hitting zone. You will have a shallow approach to the ball, right to left divot patterns (if you make divots) or a thin shot.  Your miss will be right or a hook.  Either an open or closed hip line at address will lead to low back pain, shoulder, elbow or wrists problems.

When your grips are built so that both your hand sizes fit, your feet, hips and shoulders will be square to your target line. From this square set up you will minimize the stress on your body.  

##***Left to Right Balance***
When you check your hip line with the proper grip size without the Wright Balance® Power Spots or Wright Balance® Complimentary Grip set in both hands, your hips will be square.  When you drop the club and point your thumbs, they will be in line and swing online.  However, one hand will be lower than the other.  

When one hand is lower than the other in the “Thumbs Test”, you will note that your weight is more to the side (left or right) of the hand that is lower.  What does this mean?  If you let your arms swing you will note that your swing arc is higher on the side of your “short” hand & lower on the side of your longer hand.  For example, if your left hand is lower, your backswing will be higher than your through swing when you let your arms swing.  
Consider this offset Left or Right Balance with your Putter.  You will either have descending or ascending impact.  In your full swing, when you naturally load more left or right at address, you are setting up changes in your pivot, lateral motion and an inability to properly sequence your motion.   Ask your Wright Balance® Professional about the Wright Balance My Core 360 exercise program that creates right to left balance, increased overall Core Strength and greater Power & Balance.
 
***Grip Size & Heel to Toe Balance***

Based upon your measured hand size, your Wright Balance® Professional will test 3 Grip Sizes within industry standards to determine which size sets your ideal heel to toe balance for maximum Power.  All 3 sizes will square your hips at address.  However, only one of the 3 sizes will set your heel to toe balance for maximum Core Separation & Power & and unrestricted pivot and motion sequence.

When you test the 3 sizes, your Wright Balance® Professional will show you a “Power Spot” and Complementary Grip that will increase your Power & Range of Motion.  The  Wright Balance® Grip will also increase your accuracy and distance.  Your misses will be online.  You will add a half to full club in distance. 

You will notice a difference in heel to toe balance between the 3 different grip sizes & a significant difference in Power in one of the 3.  Now you are ready to re-grip your clubs to the size that tested with the most power & your  correct Putter Grip Size.  
 
Many golf stores and club fitting professionals change grips.  However, keep in mind that they are used to changing standard grips with no extra tape wraps and very few midsize and oversize grips.  I would suggest having one club gripped to your size specifications & checking the work before doing all of your clubs.  If you are doing your own clubs, the following guidelines will help.  I would suggest you share this summary with your Club Maker or Grip Technician.

***Checking the Grip Size***

As of this writing, you can use the following as a general guide when deciding what grips to place on your clubs.  Grip sizes are classified as Undersized, Standard, Mid-Size & Oversize / Jumbo.  There is a movement to change the term “Jumbo” to Oversize.  **The*Golf Industry Standard is to measure 2 inches down from the top ring of the butt cap**.  

**When measured 2 inches down from the top ring of the butt cap**:

The Undersized Grip installed is 850 mils
The Standard Grip installed is 900 to 915 mils
The Mid-Size Grip installed is 960 mils
The Oversized / Jumbo Grip installed is 1020 mils

**The following are measurement to the Middle finger of the Left hand on the installed grips by size**  

1.  **Undersized Grip:** When measured to your left hand Middle Finger is approximately 810 to 820 mils.
2. **Standard Grip:** When measured to your left hand Middle Finger is approximately 870 to 880 mils.
3. **Mid-Sized Grip:** When measured to your left hand Middle Finger is approximately 920-925 mils.
4. **Over-sized / Jumbo Grip:** When measured to your left hand Middle Finger is approximately 985 mils.

**Note:**  The Golf Pride Tour Velvet tends to run 10 to 20 mils smaller on Mid-Size & Oversize / Jumbo Grips as it tends to stretch more than other grips when installed. 

There is also variability in the grip sizes by the type of grip you use and the butt diameter of your shafts.  The butt diameter on your wood shafts will be 10 to 15 mils larger than your irons butt diameter with a few exceptions.  

If you roll back the grip at the shaft & look inside the end of the grip you will see a few letters and one of these notations: R60, R58 or R56.  Hold the shaft so the clubhead points upward.  Roll the edge of the grip down to find the number label.  You may have to roll the grip down ½ inch or more.  Sometimes only the numbers will be labeled.  Those numbers represent the internal diameter of the grip.  The most common sizes are the 60 and 58.  The 56 size is found mostly in junior grips.  The R60 has a thinner wall than the R58.  If you have to use extra wraps, use the R58 grip.

#**Insert Photo Illustration** of roll down of grip to see #s
   
If you are doing your own re-gripping, you will have to ask about the size of the grip in the Golf Store.  They will be labeled on the grip.  They are almost always R58 or R60.  If you need an R56 (undersized grip) you might have to special order the grips.  If your hands are small, don’t conclude that you need the R56.  As I noted, the R60 is not bigger, the wall of the grip is thinner.  This is important information for you to keep in mind when you have your grips changed in the future.

The results of your sizing might surprise you.  Your Wright Balance® Professional will know how to adjust your grip sizing to both fit your Core Region and to accommodate industry standards.   

**Note:**  Grips will “stretch” when you add extra tape wraps only if they have a seam.  Check your grips to see if they have a seam.  It is easy to determine.  It will run down the back side of the grip from the club butt to the shaft.  This applies to Putter Grips as well.

When you are re-gripping your clubs, as a rule of thumb, each extra wrap of tape will add 8 mils.  After 3 or 4 extra wraps, you will begin to get 7, 6 mils and so on.  However, 5 to 10 mils variance with extra wraps will have little effect in the overall grip sizing.

**How to Measure When You Re-grip Your Clubs**

Measure to the Middle Finger of your left hand.  If you grip down on your clubs, measure at the position of your Middle Finger to determine your current playing grip size.   Place your left hand on the club, note where your middle finger is on the grip and measure at that point 90 degrees to the face.   If your right hand is larger or smaller than your left by 40 mils, check with your Wright Balance® Professional to determine if you need to accommodate that difference in your irons and woods.  Otherwise, your left hand size is all you need to consider when fitting your irons and woods.  Your grip size with the Putter will need to be fit to both your left and right hands.  

Measure your bottom hand exactly the same way. If you need to increase the Grip Size for your bottom hand, add extra wraps at the middle of the index finger of your top hand.  The extra wraps should be set about 1/8 inch apart.  Spacing the extra wraps of tape will eliminate the possibility of creating a “horizontal waist".  Additionally, rotate the seam of all each extra wraps ¼ turn to avoid building a vertical seam on the finished grip.  

Once finished, your left and right knee flex will be identical and your hip line will be square when you address the ball.  From this “square” position, you will have more consistency and straighter ball flight.  

To gain Range of Motion, Power & Left to Right Balance, you will need to add your Wright Balance® Grip (Power Spot and Complimentary Grip) to your new grip size.

**The Wright Balance Grip** 

If you have worked with a Certified Wright Balance® Professional who is also doing hand sizing, you have learned how to place your hands on the club for maximum rotation with the least stress on your body, more accuracy and distance and center face contact.  Soreness and pain following practice and play will diminish and your chance of injury due to an imbalanced set up will be eliminated.  

If you use the Wright Balance® Grip Trainer, you can practice your Complimentary Grip throughout the day no matter what you are doing.  Ask your Wright Balance® Professional for a promo code to purchase the Grip Trainer  at a reduced cost.

***Frequently Asked Questions***

**So why re-grip my clubs if the Wright Balance® Grip will square my hipline?**  

The size of the grip will impact your heel to toe Balance and, as a result, your Power.  Let's assume you are a Lower Core Player with your Middle Finger Power Spots set on the club and you have been using your Wright Balance® Grip Trainer and you have a complimentary grip.  Additionally, you have done your Wright Balance® Core 360 Exercises.  As a Lower Core Player you should be over the Center of your Arches.  However, your grip is too small for your Core Region.  This smaller grip size will move you forward toward the balls of your feet.   As a Lower Core Player, you want to be over the center of your arches.  Your ability to separate your Upper & Low Core in your backswing & clear your hips at impact is going to be compromised by your grip size.

Our original research showed that the correct grip size squares the shoulders, hips and feet.  What we have subsequently learned is that, if you have the correct Grip Size but you **DO NOT** have the Wright Balance® Grip (Middle Finger Power Spots) correct, the following will happen:


 -   Your shaft plane will be neutral (arms and hands will hang under your shoulders).
 
 - Your range of motion in your backswing and thru swing will be restricted.

 - You will have pain and stiffness after practice or play due to your restriction of motion.

 - You will have center face contact and you will have accuracy with compromised distance (your distance will be ½ to a full club shorter but on line.)

 

**What happens if my grip size is correct and I have the Wright Balance Grip Middle finger Power Spots and complimentary grip as I place my hands on the club?**

 

 - Your hips will be square
 -    Your shaft plane will be neutral and your arms and hands will hang under your shoulders
 -   Your range of motion in your backswing and thru swing will be free of restriction and you will pick up distance
 - Any soreness and stiffness you used to have after practice or play due to your restriction of motion will diminish
 - You will have center face contact and your distance will increase from a ½ to a full club.  

#END EDIT 5.8.17

**What happens if your grip size is not correct but you have your hands placed on the club properly?**

All of the above will be present when you set up in your Dominant Core Region Stance Width except your heel to toe balance.  

If you set up in a stance width that is not in your Dominant Core Region, you will lose the effects of the grip size on your set up.  Your hips will open or close, you will have restriction in your motion, etc.  

The bottom line, if your grips are not your exact size, learn the Wright Balance® Grip, determine your stance Width for your Dominant Core Region and determine the impact of left to right balance on your motion.
Let’s assume you have the Wright Balance® Grip placement of your hands on your Putter.  However, your grip size is not correct.  What will happen?
The net result of the improper grip size when you have the Wright Balance® Grip placement of your hands is that your left to right balance will be uneven.  That is, you will have more weight either on the left or right side. Is this important?  Absolutely, it is.  Assume for a moment that your hands are on your putter properly but your weight is more on your right side than left.  That means that you will have a lower backstroke and a higher finish.  You will hit up on the ball putting over spin on the roll.  If your weight is more left, you will have a higher backstroke and a lower through stroke with a downward impact on the ball.  
You will hear opinions from both sides as to which is better for putting.  As a rule, whatever the person does in their putting stroke becomes their opinion as to what is best.  I would say the following:  Have the proper sized grip for your left and right hands on your putter and the proper placement of your hands.  Your backstroke and through stroke are identical in height and you will roll the ball consistently.  Changing loft for bumpy or fast greens, if you are a purist, is the only change you will need to make.   
As you move into the full swing, again, you will not have left to right balance.  It may sound like a small thing but left to right balance at address becomes significant as you start your motion.  If your ideal pivot is around your right side but your weight is more left at address due to your grip size, you will tend to move laterally off the ball.  Grip size and balance are tied intimately together.
As a follow-up to this discussion, If your hands are not on the club properly, I would encourage you to look for our EBOOK, The Wright Balance® Grip.
 
 Now that you have your proper grip size for your clubs, I would encourage you to re-grip one club and check the impact on your knee flex and hip line.  Then hit balls. 
 
**Your Putter**

There are no standard putter grip sizes.  For decades, there was one size for putter grips, very small.  In fact, a standard putter grip is smaller than the standard, off the shelf grip for irons and woods.  In the past few years larger putter grips are the trend.  

You can check the impact your putter grip size has on your hip line (core muscle tension) & Left to Right Balance exactly the same way you checked your irons and woods.

For the past several years, we have used a variety of putter grip sizes and built them up with extra wraps of tape.  Due to the lack of a standard putter grip size other than the very small grip, each putter grip had to be built, measured and the grip “blown off” until the exact size was accomplished.  It was an expensive, time consuming process.   If you wish to have your grips fit using a size that measures to your size, you can.  However, most of the time we wrap over a conventional putter grip using premeasured materials that will look and feel like a putter grip.  It is difficult to get an oversized Putter Grip that fits your hands as many of them have a known installed diameter and they don't stretch.  Most importantly, when your putter grip fits you will see lines accurately, you will be aimed at a toothpick at 6 feet and your putter path will stay on your target line longer, all things important to be a good putter.
