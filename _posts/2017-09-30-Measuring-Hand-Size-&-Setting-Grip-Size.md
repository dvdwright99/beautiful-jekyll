#**Level 5 Certification:  Grip & Grip Size**   
------------------



**After almost 30 years of research into grip size we know the following:**
> 1.   Grip Size changes by Core Region Putter through Driver 
2. Grip size changes heel to toe Balance
3. The size of the grip allows you to test by 100 mil increments within your Student's Dominant Core Region & usually within industry standards.   
4. Five Simple measurements yield grip size when input on the Wright Balance site
5. When Lower & Upper Core players have exactly the same hand size, the Lower Core Player will play a larger Grip than the Upper Core Player 
7. When players test the range of 3 different sizes that fit their Dominant Core Region, they will experience changes in heel to toe balance.  Each of those sizes will square the hip line.  However, only one of those 3 sizes will test for maximum Power.   
 
**Why is Grip Size Important?**

Everything we do while holding or gripping something  to swinging a club, racquet or bat, walking with a cane or walker requires balance.  Our Wright Balance® research shows that grip and hand size can either support balance or create imbalance.

When you place something in your left and/or your right hand that does not fit your hand size, the improper size creates tension on one side of your core muscles, depending on Stance Width, and compromises balance.  This core tension causes your hips to rotate left or right to an “open” or “closed” position creating imbalance at ground level as shown in this illustration.  

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/4pdhKWj.jpg)

This includes anything from a golf club, putter, bat, tennis racquet, rake, broom, shovel or even a cane or crutches.   Grip Sizing has numerous applications, I am going to focus on Golf & Baseball in this overview.

When the grip size fits both the left and right hand, you will get a balance configuration similar to the one below.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/GAy2lWT.jpg)

**How do golfers play with the incorrect size?**  Players learn to place their hands on the club (stronger or weaker) in a way that compensates for an open or closed hip line.   The compensation still creates Core Tension, but a square hip line.  Core Tension is a predisposing condition for injury. 

#**Grip Size Measurements**

What is a “mil”?

Golf grips are measured in inches. One (1) mil is equal to 1/1000 inch.  The Golf industry has established the following Standards:
>1. The **Industry Standard** Grip Size is measured for the Left hand only, 2 inches down from the top ring of the Butt Cap of the Golf Grip for irons & **2 inches down** from the top for the Putter.
2.  An installed "Standard" Size grip measures 900 to 915 mils 
3. An installed "Undersized" Grip measures 850-70 mils
4. An installed Midsize Grip measures 960 mils
5. An installed "Jumbo" or "Oversized" Grip measures 1020 mils.
**NOTE**:  When considering these measurements, please know that the industry standard size is taken 2 inches down from the top ring of the Butt Cap of the Club  
 
Wright Balance® grip size standards are measured to the middle finger of the left hand on irons and woods and the middle finger of both hands on the putter.

Why is this important?  Some players grip down on the club.  The grip has a natural taper of about 50 to 70 mils from the left to right hand. Palm width, position of a player's hands on the club and the natural taper of the grip are reasons we measure to the middle finger of the left hand on irons and woods and the middle finger of both hands on the putter.  Please keep these factors in mind as you read this overview. 
  

**Grip Size vs Hand Size**

Bigger is not better.  Fitting your student's left hand for their irons and woods and their right and left hands for putter to the proper sizes is the goal.  A grip that fits your hand size sets your ideal ***heel to toe*** Balance, minimizes the stress in your core muscles, squares your hip line, facilitates maximum separation of the Upper & Lower Core in the swing and creates a balanced set up to the ball with greater Power recruitment from the ground (Ground Reaction Force).   

There is a belief among students & teachers that if you want to take your hands out of your swing, you should use bigger grips; if you want to use more hands in your game, get smaller grips.  If you are an Upper Core Player, you want to use your arms and hands.  If you are a Lower Core Player, you want to use your body.  An Upper Core Player's release is with the arms and hands.  The Lower Core Players release is with their body.  As might be expected, your Upper Core player will have smaller grips than the Lower Core, even in some cases when the Upper Core player has larger overall hands.  

Just because someone is tall and wide does not mean their hand size is large.  I have a senior tour player who is 6 feet 2 inches who uses an undersized grip.  Standard grips are too big for him.  Two time Masters winner Bubba Watson uses 12 extra wraps of tape under his right hand and 10 extra under his left (he is left-handed.)  US Open Winner Retief Goosen plays an oversize grip with 7 extra wraps.  

One of my students, PGA Tour Winner and former Long Drive Champion, Dennis Paulson uses a standard left hand grip size.  He put 6 extra wraps under his right hand (his hand size on our laser hand scanner measured   880 mils for his left hand and 876 mils for his right, precisely 6 extra wraps under his right hand).  Dennis intuitively found his correct size during his early years on tour.  He experimented with different grip sizes until he found the one that felt best to him.  

Another of my students, seven year PGA Tour veteran, Pat Burke measured 932 mils left hand and 873 right hand (also measured on our laser hand scanner.)  Pat had a career ending wrist injury in 1997 that he attributes to playing the incorrect grip sizes.  

If your student has have very large hands, there is a sizing adjustment to maintain Core Balance and move them to a size that will minimize swing weight changes and allow them to play a grip size closer to one of the industry standard grips.      

**How to Check the Current Grip Size**

Have your student assume one of their Dominant Core Region Stance Widths you determined in testing.

Place the Blue Bar and Bungee on your students hips.  Be certain to note that their hips are square to their stance line.  Have them add knee flex to be certain their hips are square **without** a club.  

From a "Standing Tall" position, ask your student to grip their 6 or 7 iron like a baseball bat.  (Note:  The orientation of your student's hands on the club will open or close their hip line when they assume a Golf Grip.  The majority of players grip a baseball bat without compensations in their grip.)  This will give you a true observation of the impact of grip size.  In the following illustration, LPGA Legends Tour Winner, Laurie Rinker demonstrates the impact of Grip Size using a baseball grip.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/wJDGJV0.jpg)

This video will provide you with the testing of grip size in a Middle Core Player.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YQS5qcWLLEQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Once the grip is assumed, ask your player to add a slight knee flex.  This knee flex will amplify  any Core Tension that will produce pelvic rotation if the grip does not fit.  Note that Laurie's hips remain square in the following illustration after adding knee flex.  This grip size fits her left hand.  Laurie's Grip Size is 915 mils.  I will return to that in a bit.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/hC6NhPc.jpg)

You test the Putter Grip Size the same way you do the full swing grip size, using the baseball grip with all fingers touching.   Notice how Colby's putter grip size does not fit.     


 
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/P6epzwL.jpg)

When he sets up with a grip that fits his left hand, as in the photo illustration below, his hips are square.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOjmmk7Qo-g?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


First, let’s go through the hand measurement process and the entry of that information on the Wright Balance website. 

**Hand Measurements**

This illustration is a closeup of the Finger Measurement Form you were issued by the Wright Balance Team.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/aHWGvaX.jpg)

Note that the lines on this form are **Green** & **Blue**.  The **Green** lines have odd numbers and the **Blue** lines have even numbers.  There is a **Vertical** **BLUE** Line dividing the Finger measurement form.  That Vertical Blue Line is where your student will center the card between their fingers as they do their right & left middle finger measurements.

When your student uses this form, it is **important** that they place the measurement form **GENTLY** between their middle and ring fingers, ***hold the form at eye level*** and, using a magnifying glass, verbalize what color line and its corresponding number is at the tip of their middle finger.  Note: you are only measuring the Middle Finger of the left and right hands.  Again,  ***Do not apply downward pressure*** when the form is placed between the Ring and Middle Fingers.  Downward pressure will impact the measurement.

If your student reports that a green line is at the tip of their middle finger, they should also report an odd number as their measurement.  If they report a blue line is at the tip of their middle finger, they should report an even number.
 
Be certain that the measurement card is held perpendicular to the ground and the card is held at eye level. If the card is not held at eye level, your student will report a higher or lower number and the accuracy of their grip size will be compromised.  You will be able to test the accuracy of your measurements after you set up a club to their measured grip size.

 **1.**  Place the measurement card **GENTLY** between the middle and ring fingers of the Left Hand on the center **BLUE Line** of the measurement tool.  ***Do not apply downward pressure*** when the card is placed between the Middle & Ring Fingers.  Any pressure will alter the final measurement.
 **2.**  Ask your student to hold the form at eye level and, using a magnifying glass.  be certain they have the **BLUE line** dividing the middle of the measurement tool between their Middle and Ring Fingers.  Ask your student the line color at the tip of their Middle Finger.  
 **3.** Ask your student the Corresponding Number on the line.  (Note:  the green lines are odd numbers and the blue lines are even numbers.)
**4.**   Be certain the number matches (odd vs even) the line color.   If the line color and number correspond, make a note of the number. 
**5.** Repeat 1 - 4 above until your student reports the same measurement twice and make a note of the number for their left hand.
**6.** Repeat 1 - 5 on your student's right hand and record the number for the right hand.
 
  **Palm Width**

Turn the Finger Measurement card over and you will note a hand width measurement scale.  Place the edge of your student's hand at the level of the knuckles on the scale as shown in this illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/YQYN7J9.png)

Position their hand on "0" at their knuckle line on their right hand as shown in the illustration.  Note the width of their right palm.  Repeat this measurement on their left palm.

 **Measurements Entry online**

Your student MUST complete their profile before doing either the Stance Width measurements or Grip Size.  Click on "Add User" as in the Illustration below.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/uhYbA8H.jpg)

Then, click on "Add Customer" as shown in the illustration below.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/M3YkCSz.jpg)


  Then, Click on "**Grip Size**" as shown in the illustration below.  

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/Q4wHm2C.jpg)

The Size Template will appear as shown in the illustration below:

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/ypxhrtZ.jpg)

Then, input the tested Dominant Core Region.  Input the number of the Core Region as shown in the illustration below.  If your student tested a 7, 8 or 9 for example put the exact Core Region number they tested.  As already noted, grip size changes by Core Region.  Do not arbitrarily put any number in any part of this form.  All of these measurements are important to insure that your student gets the proper grip size results.    
 
 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/rZnwmnx.jpg)

Again, you must do your student's Dominant Core Region assessment to do the Grip Size.  Grip Size changes by Core Region.  The first entry you will make is their Dominant Core Region (1-9).  The left & right Middle Finger Length and Palm Width of each hand are the other entries. 


 Once you have completed the Grip Size entry click on "Proceed" and enter your "Fitter Code".  Your student's results will be immediately emailed to you as shown in the illustration below.
  
 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/MDlo0TA.jpg)


#**Testing Grip Sizes**

Based upon your student's measured hand size,  test 3 Grip Sizes within industry standards to determine which size sets their ideal heel to toe balance for maximum Power.  All 3 sizes will square their hips at address.  However, only one of the 3 sizes will set their heel to toe balance for maximum Core Separation & Power & and unrestricted pivot and motion sequence.

When you test the 3 sizes,  there will be a difference in heel to toe balance between the 3 different grip sizes & a significant difference in Power in one of the 3.  Palm size plays a role in the grip size that sets the balance or maximum Power.

Use Pre-Wrap if you need to build up a grip.  Pre-Wrap is available at any Sporting Goods store or you can purchase it online via the Wright Balance Shopping Cart.

You will use the pre-wrap on irons, woods and putters when you test.  use the pre-wrap to build up the club to the desired measurement.  You will find that most of the time it will only take a few wraps to get to the size you need.  If you wrap the grip with minimal overlap when you use the pre-wrap, each wrap adds approximately 20 mils.  The following illustrations show the pre-wrap on an iron during testing.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/J5pQBHe.jpg)

Use a piece of chalk to mark where the left middle finger for the desired Grip Size is to be placed for the testing.  

For very small grips, you won't need to add pre-wrap.  Measure down the grip to the desired size and mark with a piece of chalk as shown in this photo illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/JThUO4B.jpg)

The average grip tapers 50 to 70 mils from the middle of the right hand to the middle of the left hand.  For the full swing, you won't need to be concerned with size discrepancies between the left and right hands unless they are greater than 40 mils.  In that case, check the left hand only and then add the right to see if the right hand changes the hip line.

These three 3 videos show the testing for Grip Size of LPGA Legends Tour Player, Laurie Rinker (Middle Core) & her two sons Brent Graham (Lower Core) and Tim Graham (Upper Core).

This Video is testing grip size with Middle Core  Player Laurie Rinker.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YQS5qcWLLEQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Note the strategy in each of the videos of testing 3 sizes of grips by 100 mil increments.  The first test was to have the players assume a baseball grip to test to verify that their hips remained square when they changed Grip Sizes.  The Grip Sizes are set in 100 mil increments.   For example, If the measured grip size is 1085, test 1085, 985 and 885.   If you don't find strength in those 3 sizes, you will need to build up a grip with pre-wrap to test 1185.  There are grips on the market for players with very large hands that will cover that size range.  What if the players hands are small? If the Grip Size is 675, you will need to test 775, 875 and 975.  You won't find a grip size of 675 and you will have to measure down an undersized grip to get to 775.  Be sure to mark a chalk line at the desired size on the grip where you want your student to place their middle finger of their left hand.

Palm size plays a role in determining the ideal tested grip size.  Lauries Grip Size measured at 1015.  She tested strongest at 915.  When Laurie's grip tested too small (815 mils), her weight moved toward her toes as shown in the following illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/fCd79LR.jpg) 

When her tested grip size was too big (1015 mils), her measured size), she moved toward her heels.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/N8ATnOv.jpg)

Laurie showed the greatest power with a 915 mils grip.  The 915 Grip Size put Laurie in her ideal balance position.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/3in6Tq8.jpg)  

This is a video of Grip Size Testing of Upper Core Player, Tim Graham.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/go_7D9x-VB8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In this video you will note that Tim's grips were tested at 100 Mil increments.  Note that his hips were square in all 3 test.  However, note that with the grip that was too large moved Tim toward his heels and compromised his balance when the size was tested in the downswing plane. 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/woGaWC4.jpg)

The grip size that was too small moved Tim toward his toes and also compromised his balance when tested in the downswing plane.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/3JeWAex.jpg)

When Tim found his ideal balance with maximum Power, he could not be moved out of balance when the shaft was pushed downward in the downswing plane.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/zni2NBk.jpg)


This is a video of Grip Size Testing of Lower Core Player, Brent Graham.  


      
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z51ZNDHKPzA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

When Brent was measured, his hand size was 1165 Mils.  When tested at 1165, his balance moved to his heels and he was unable to hold the club at the top when downward pressure was applied.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/rQtnQcf.jpg)

When  Brent was tested at 965 Mils, he described his weight moving toward his toes and, again, he was unable to support the downward pressure on the downswing plane.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/jLFkxnc.jpg)

When Brent was tested at 1065, he described being centered over his arches and he was not able to be moved in the downswing plane when pressure was applied.

#**Getting the Proper Size Done** 



Now you are ready to re-grip your Student's clubs to the size that tested with the most power & their correct Putter Grip Size.  
 
Many golf stores and club fitting professionals change grips.  However, keep in mind that they are used to changing standard grips with no extra tape wraps and very few midsize and oversize grips.  I would suggest having one club gripped to your student's size specifications & checking the work before doing all their clubs.  If you are doing their clubs on site, the following guidelines will help.  I would suggest you share this summary with your Club Maker or Grip Technician.

***Checking the Grip Size***

As of this writing, you can use the following as a general guide when deciding what grips to place on your clubs.  Grip sizes are classified as Undersized, Standard, Mid-Size & Oversize / Jumbo.  There is a movement to change the term “Jumbo” to Oversize.  **The*Golf Industry Standard is to measure 2 inches down from the top ring of the butt cap**.  

The Following is a "Guideline".  As you will read, the Tour Velvet Grip tends to run smaller by 10 to 20 mils (depending on shaft size)  than the measurements in the chart below.

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/2WGCz1a.jpg)

The above Chart for **Industry Standards** is also expressed as shown below.   

The Undersized Grip installed is 850 mils
The Standard Grip installed is 900 to 915 mils
The Mid-Size Grip installed is 960 mils
The Oversized / Jumbo Grip installed is 1020 mils

**The following are measurements to the Middle finger of the Left hand on the installed grips by size**  

1.  **Undersized Grip:** When measured to your left hand Middle Finger is approximately 830 to 840 mils.
2. **Standard Grip:** When measured to your left hand Middle Finger is approximately 870 to 880 mils.
3. **Mid-Sized Grip:** When measured to your left hand Middle Finger is approximately 920-925 mils.
4. **Over-sized / Jumbo Grip:** When measured to your left hand Middle Finger is approximately 985 mils.

**Note:**  The Golf Pride Tour Velvet tends to run 10 to 20 mils smaller on Mid-Size & Oversize / Jumbo Grips as it tends to stretch more than other grips when installed. 

There is also variability in the grip sizes by the type of grip you use and the butt diameter of your shafts.  The butt diameter on your wood shafts will be 10 to 15 mils larger than your irons butt diameter with a few exceptions.  

If you roll back the grip at the shaft & look inside the end of the grip you will see a few letters and one of these notations: R60, R58 or R56.  Hold the shaft so the clubhead points upward.  Roll the edge of the grip down to find the number label.  You may have to roll the grip down ½ inch or more.  Sometimes only the numbers will be labeled.  Those numbers represent the internal diameter of the grip.  The most common sizes are the 60 and 58.  The 56 size is found mostly in junior grips.  The R60 has a thinner wall than the R58.  If you have to use extra wraps, use the R58 grip.

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/qx1VShe.jpg)
   
New grips purchased in the Golf Store will be labeled on the grip.  They are almost always R58 or R60.  If you need an R56 (undersized grip) you might have to special order the grips.  If your student's hands are small, don’t conclude that they need the R56.  As I noted, **the R60 is not bigger, the wall of the grip is thinner**.  This is important information for you to keep in mind when your students have their grips changed in the future.

The results of the sizing might surprise you.  You will be able to test in 100 Mil increments adjust the grip size to both fit your student's Core Region and to accommodate industry standards.  Be certain to test until you get maximum strength. 

**Note:**  Grips will “stretch” when you add extra tape wraps only if they have a seam.  Check grips to see if they have a seam.  It is easy to determine.  It will run down the back side of the grip from the club butt to the shaft.  This applies to Putter Grips as well.

When you are re-gripping  clubs, as a rule of thumb, each extra wrap of tape will add 8 mils.  After 3 or 4 extra wraps, you will begin to get 7, 6 mils and so on.  However, 5 to 10 mils variance with extra wraps will have little effect in the overall grip sizing.

#**Putter Grip Sizing**

There are no standard putter grip sizes.  For decades, there was one size for putter grips, very small.  In fact, a standard putter grip is smaller than the standard, off the shelf grip for irons and woods.  In the past few years larger putter grips are the trend.  

You can check the impact putter grip size has on your student's  hip line (core muscle tension) & Left to Right Balance exactly the same way you checked their irons and woods.

Recall that our first observation with regard to path in Dr. Jobe's biomechanics lab was that the Putter Path would track the balance line in the feet.  This illustration shows a balance configuration where the putter path  would track inside out.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/pBaqD7G.jpg)

This illustration show a balance configuration where the putter path would track outside in.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/zpGblx2.jpg)

The Line of Force in the following illustration suggest a path that is ideal.  
Note that this illustration shows a straight line of Force for a Lower Core Player

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/GAy2lWT.jpg)

If this configuration is created for a Lower Core Player, it is likely going to work for them.  However, if it was created for an Upper or Middle Core Player, the Lie Angle is likely too flat, moving the player back in their Stance.

There are multiple factors that will produce the balance line or Line of Force.  They are:

 - Stance Width
 - Grip (Placement of hands on Club)
 - Grip Size
 - Putter Lie Angle
 - Putter Length
 - 
You are able to control for Stance Width, Grip and Grip Size within your lesson.  I would encourage you to look at the putter Lie Angle and Length as well.

Length is determined by Stance Width.  The wider the Stance Width, the shorter the Putter will be.  Your student will have multiple Stance Widths to choose from their Wright Balance Stance Width Results.  Fitting the Grip Size and Grip first when you change the Grip Size is where I would begin.  Once your student has a chance to get used to the putter grip size change and they find a comfortable width, you can followup with length and lie angle.

Let's talk first about Grip Size.  I would begin by showing your student where they are aimed with the putter.  If you have a putter aim system, I would do this measurement before you change the Grip Size, Grip or Stance Width.  Ask your student to set up to a ball on a target line as shown in this illustration.  (Wright Balance has the Putter Aim assessment system shown in this illustration on the Wright Balance Products Page.)  

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/T6eEe3o.jpg)

The other check you should do with the putter is your students visual perception of lines.  Use a golf ball with a line on it aimed at a toothpick (This is also a Wright Balance Product).  You will note that your students visual perception of the line is left or right of the toothpick unless they have exact compensations.  


![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/y35g3G3.jpg)


My general rule of thumb is that if a student is aimed precisely and they see the line on the ball aimed at the toothpick,  I don't change anything.  Those are the players who will tell you they are good putters.  I would suggest you work only on speed control at that point and change nothing with the grip or their set up.  If they have 2 putters, then you may ask to re-grip one of them.   

I would encourage you to tell your student that once the Putter Stance Width, Grip Size, Ball Position, Posture and Grip is done, they **do not need to think about their mechanics**.  I would advise them that their setup will take care of the path and they don't need to think about making a stroke.  That will free their mind to focus on pictures for speed.

These photos and video appeared earlier in this EBook but they are  important to be certain that the putter grip fits your student.  The major difference in fitting your students grip size with the Putter is that both the left and right hands must be fit on the putter.

The following illustration shows that this Putter Grip fits this player's left and right hands.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/DVMqxxE.jpg)

This illustration shows that this Putter Grip does not fit either the left or right hand or neither hand.   You will need to check first the left hand and then the right hand, then both hands using the baseball grip on the putter.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/P6epzwL.jpg)

This video also appeared earlier in this EBook.


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOjmmk7Qo-g?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Check the putter grip using one hand at a time.  Ask your student to place their left hand on the putter as they would on a baseball (or cricket) bat making sure all fingers are touching.  Have them keep their right hand behind the hip bar.  Be certain their Stance Width is on one of their Dominant Core Region Widths. 

For the past several years, we have used a variety of putter grip sizes and built them up with extra wraps of tape.  Due to the lack of a standard putter grip size other than the very small grip, each putter grip had to be built, measured and the grip “blown off” until the exact size was accomplished.  It was an expensive, time consuming process.   They process has become much easier and faster as you will see below. 

#**How to Determine the Putter Grip Size** 

Take the result you received from the Wright Balance Grip Sizing.  This illustration is an example of those results.  In this example you will note that the irons, woods and Putter left and right hands are within 20 thousandths.  We don't have the final data in on the putter Grip Size adjustment.  That is, if this player test best at 965 for their irons and woods (minus 100 Mils from measured size) do we also subtract 100 Mils for the proper Putter Size?  I would be inclined to use the actual Putter Grip Size shown on the results page.  As we do more research on the sizing, I will let you know our findings.  For the time being I would suggest that you use the Grip Sizing from the results. 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/tMZKnee.jpg)

 **The results below are very different for this player.**   

   ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/YOXHHJW.jpg)

Note that the Upper Core Grip Size for the Irons is Left Hand 1045 Mils and Right Hand 965 Mils.  Since the left hand is larger, you will likely be okay with this left to right difference with irons and woods.  The natural taper of the iron and woods grip is 50 to 70 Mils,  but not the Putter.  

This players Putter Grip Size for the Left and Right hands will need to be set exactly to his hand sizes.  Most Putter Grips have very little if any taper except for the traditional putter grip style.  

Like the irons and woods, Putter Grip Size is measured 90 degrees to the face.  It may be easier to think of measuring the width of the Putter (side to side) **not** the depth (front to back).   Some of the modern large grips have posted the diameter of their grips online.  If the left and right hands are close in size, you may be able to find a Putter Grip online that fits your student.

I wrapped (and still do) Putter Grips to precisely fit the players left and right hands.   When players have small grip sizes or sizes you are unable to find online, you will need to wrap your student's putter grip using pre-wrap as the underlisting and a Tennis Grip to get the proper Grip Size.  I would encourage you to wrap the Putter yourself.  

Most of the time we wrap over a conventional putter grip using premeasured materials that will look and feel like a putter grip.  It is difficult to get an oversized Putter Grip that fits a player's hands as many of them have a known installed diameter and they don't stretch.  Most importantly, when your student's putter grip fits, and they are in one of their dominant Core Region Stance Widths,  they will see lines accurately and they will be aimed at a toothpick at 6 feet.  Their putter path will stay on their target line longer, all things important to be a good putter. 

This illustration shows the application of Pre-wrap as the underlisting while building up the Putter Grip in preparation to wrapping the putter with a Tennis Regrip.   This process is demonstrated in the video that follows this illustration.

# **Baseball** & Cricket

Baseball has been part of the Wright Balance research process since the early 2000s.  In 2009 I went with Dr. Michael Mellman to 7 time MLB All Star Reggie Smith's baseball hitting facility.  I measured Matt Kemp, Los Angeles Dodger Center Fielder at the time,   for Stance Width and Bat handle size.  Matt took his yardstick and bat size and stepped into a hitting cage where he spent the next 30 minutes practicing striding from one Dominant Core Region Stance Width to another.  Matt was the first MLB player fit by Wright Balance.   Reggie Smith subsequently took the fitting system to MLB Spring training for 3 years in a row.  

Now we have grip sizing by Core Region.  We believe that their are Lower, Middle & Upper Core hitters as well.  The ability of your student to set the trail arm in their through swing will be a factor as you learned in Level 1 Wright Balance Certification.  Baseball coaches have a bias of instruction teaching either a "linear" or "rotational" swing.  I heard from MLB Veteran Reggie Smith "rotational" teacher about the many "discussions" he had over the years with  MLB Veteran Tony Gwynn "linear" teacher about what was the most efficient way to swing.  The right or wrong in this discussion is likely related to the player's ability to externally rotate their shoulder in a Lower Core Stance Width.  The measured Carrying / Power Angle is where the answer resides.  

Set up with a bat that fits your hand sizes in a Upper Core Stance Width with a Carrying / Power Angle of 160 or so and note that your right elbow is close to horizontal to the ground as shown in this Illustration.  Be certain to set the Upper Core Power Spots as you do with Golf.

 Jai tested with Maximum strength in his Lower Core.  However, his Carrying / Power Angle measure 158 in a Lower Core Stance Width and 168 in his Upper Core Stance Widths.  He had to be a "linear" hitter.  He would not be able to set his right elbow in his through swing.  If you recall, Jai also had to play golf from Upper Core Stance Widths and Grip.

Move to a Lower Core Stance width and set the Lower Core Power Spots in both your left and right hands and you will note that your right elbow drops as shown with Jai in the following illustration.

Teaching should be to your student's ability to set up and swing within their biomechanical capability.  Measuring players ability to externally rotate their shoulder in their Dominant Core Region is the first step to determining what they are physically capable of doing.  

Note the difference in the right elbow positions in these 2 MLB Players, both home run swings. Also note the difference in their left elbow positions and the bat angles.  Which one is Middle or Upper Core Swing and which one is a Lower Core Swing?

Here is a better view of a Lower Core Hitter from behind and above.  Note again the bat position, the right elbow and the clearance of the hips, also a home run swing.

Which one is the best swing?  The swing that fits the players body.   The bottom line is:  Be sure when you fit grip size that you are fitting the player with a bat handle size in a Core Region in which they can perform.
 
#**Visual Perception and Balance**
One of the most significant changes you will find with Grip Sizing combined with the Core 360 Exercise Program is the change in the Visual Perception of the ball in space.  Time is a "hitters friend."  When a hitter is able to accurately see the ball in space their ability to hit is elevated. 

Unlike golf, baseball players need to have freedom of movement in all directions as well as accurate visual perception.  This comment speaks to the golfer being able to do the Oblique Exercises and plank the 3 Stance Widths to play well.  The entire Core 360 Exercise Program is important for all other sports. 

To test the visual perception of lines, our early research used 6 baseballs with lines on them aimed down the middle of a plate as shown in these illustrations.

The player will see the line down the middle of the plate (without a bat) only in their Dominant Core Stance Width prior to the WB Core 360 Exercise.  When they are not in their Dominant Core Stance Width, your student will describe seeing the ball moving inside or outside.  After completing the WB Core 360 Exercises, they will report visually seeing the ball down the middle of the plate.  Introduce a bat and the visual perception of the ball moves again inside or out.

Former 10 year MLB veteran, Mike Lamb was fit the last year of his career.   These are photo illustrations of Mike's bats before (left) and after (right) his Wright Balance Fitting.  Mike had his bat "cut" to his exact size.  

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/ncrO32c.jpg)

Note that the bat at the top in the photo below is larger in the right hand than the Left.  Mike hit left handed and his left hand is larger than his right.

After Mike's performance change at the plate, he brought several of his MLB friends to the Lab for a fiting.

This video is of San Diego Padre, Drew Macias going through a Grip Size and Stance Width Fitting.

In this video, 12 time Gold Glove Winner, Omar Vizquel is discussing Stance Width and Posture for Symmetry, recruitment of Ground Force and freedom of motion.  Note that his Stance Width Measurements, Stride at the plate and Carrying (Power) Angle are the foundation of this discussion.  This was from 2012,  Omar's last year before retirement.  He was playing for the Toronto Blue Jays on pace for 3,000 hits at the time of this meeting.
