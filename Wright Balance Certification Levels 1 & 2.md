#**The Application of Force & Core Symmetry**

 When engineers design a structure, they do so with the goal of Symmetry.  When there is Symmetry, there is an equal distribution of Force throughout the foundation on the ~~strikethrough text~~ground.  This Symmetry provides the greatest stability & strength.  Symmetry minimizes the probability of collapse.  Asymmetry of a structure will result in weakness, a loss of structural integrity and a greater potential for collapse, in particular at times of physical stress.  

Similarly, when your student sets up to the ball with Core Symmetry, they have the greatest Power and a physical distribution of stress that minimizes fatigue of any one joint (s) and the least potential for injury.

Below is a diagram of  **The 9 Core Regions Recruited by Stance Width.** Wright Balance has spent 20 plus years "mapping" the Core by Stance Width.

We know that the Core entails the region of the body from the roof of the mouth to the pelvic floor.  This diagram shows 9 Regions of the Core from the Neck to the Pelvic Floor.  One of the "**Guided Discoveries**" you will test demonstrates changes in Jaw Symmetry as well demonstrating recruitment of changes in Jaw Symmetry by Stance Width.  The content in this EBook is evidence based instruction you will experience and subsequently teach your students.

The link below will take you to an EBook.  The title is **Part 2, Chapter 6**.  This EBook has links to the first 5 Chapters on the first few pages.  Please review the research history and Swings by Core Region if you have not already done so.  You will find embedded videos of the original research and related topics.

#**How important is a Square Hip Line (Parallel to the player's target line)**  
Hip line is the best indicator of balance in the feet.  Absolutely everything you are going to Learn in these Wright Balance Certification Levels is about Balance.  That includes Stance Width, Grip Size, Posture, Grip, Alignment to the target, Clubface Aim, Ball Position, the Visual Perception of Lines and much more.  All of these factors, when properly set, = Balance and when perfectly set = Core Symmetry.  Note that all of these factors make up the foundation of the swing at setup.  You will learn the "diagnosis" of problems through a simple, systematic test of each of these factors.  All of these set up factors relate to a SQUARE HIP LINE. When one of these setup positions is off, the Core tightens on one side creating a rotation of the hips, a change in clubface aim and balance.  

Our research that dates to the early 1990s was looking at hip line as shown in these illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/9147EZs.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/p8L6Mqv.jpg)

We moved from Hip Rotation in a narrow stance to the lab where we used dowel poles with light sensors to observe changes in hip and shoulder lines with changes in multiple Stance Widths and Set Up positions as shown in this illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/8dQt15x.jpg) 

We looked at players' hip lines in a variety of settings first using bars on the hips and shoulders from Champion's  Tour Player Bob E Smith with a putter...

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/9D6ZZZs.jpg)

...to golf schools as shown below.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/jfjtmeK.jpg) 

The research showed that the shoulder bar was not valid to use in the field.  However, the hip bar was a valid measure.  The hip bar became a staple in my teaching as shown here with Upper Core PGA Tour Player Kevin Stadler in the late 90s.  The hip bar was used to check both the hip line in a static measurement...

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/OyRxM50.jpg)

...and in a swing motion.  Kevin's hip turn in the backswing, his Center of Mass (COM) left and his right arm position at the top became matching positions for what we now call an Upper Core Player.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/3Oz7Yhz.jpg)

We also noted changes in clubface aim based upon heel to toe balance as demonstrated in the following illustrations of PGA Tour winner Dennis Paulson during his 1990s career.

Note the clubface closing when Dennis moved his weight toward his toes...

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/ZAh2PC9.jpg)

...and opening when Dennis moved his weight toward his heels...
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/StbEgS4.jpg)


We also explored the impact  various grip sizes had on balance in the lab.  That research started in the early 90s using Plexiglas strips.  Harvey Penick once said that if you want to learn how to grip a golf club, use a yardstick.  We started with various Plexiglas widths in the early part of the grip size research.  If you look carefully you will note that my weight is on my heels, my hips are square and my left foot is pulled back 2 inches behind my right foot.  Adjustment of the feet is how I would correct left or right hip rotation in the early 90's.  

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/L4s9Lg7.jpg) 

We learned over the years that these factors impacted heel to toe balance and left and right hip rotation.  In Dr. Jobe's biomechanics lab it became clear that the patterns of balance observed in the feet where the best indicators of swing / putter path.
   
#**Core Tension & Path**

 During the Biomechanics Lab Research Phase, there were 1000 Force Sensors in each shoe.  This is an image of the insole placed in each shoe of the study participants.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/PhKzAVJ.jpg)

This illustration shows the image produced with 1000 sensors in each shoe.  The circled boxes in each foot represent the average weight distribution, also referred to as the **Center of Force** or,  more recently referred to in other research and application settings as the **Center of Pressure**.   When you connect the **Center of Force** in each foot with a straight line, this is referred to as the **Line of Force**.

 
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/yiDPHTS.jpg)

In early 2004 during the initial research it was observed first that the Putter Path tracked the Line of Force. The same observation was made during the full swing, in particular, during the downswing, by early 2005.  
 
 
**Guided Discovery:** This illustration shows an outside-in path.  You can replicate this balance pattern if you increase the knee flex in your right knee so that it is greater than your left.  Note that your weight is forward in your right foot and back in your left.  Relax your shoulders & let your arms swing without moving your shoulders.  Note the outside-in path. 

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/yXFOvOZ.jpg)

 **Guided Discovery:** This illustration shows an inside-out path.  You can replicate this balance pattern if you increase the knee flex in your left knee so that it is greater than your right.  Note that your weight is back in your right foot and forward in your left.  Relax your shoulders & let your arms swing without moving your shoulders.  Note the inside-out path. 
 
 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/BFjBEvI.jpg)

As you will learn, your Stance Width, your Grip, Grip Size & how you set your Posture will create one of the Balance Configurations in these Illustrations.

#**Measurements to "Map" Your Student's 9 Core Regions by Stance Width**

Before you begin the measurements your student must click on **"Join"** in the top right corner as shown in this illustration.  

 
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/OJhStsP.jpg) 

Then you or your student will need to complete the registration form shown in this illustration.

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/vBmUvEH.jpg)

Your student will be sent a registration confirmation.  Ask them to click on the link in the confirmation email and complete their profile.  This profile must be completed before you may proceed.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/UkpA6Od.jpg)

Once the Registration Form is completed for your student, Login to your account.  When you Login, your profile will appear on the screen.  Click on "My Users" in the left column next to your profile as shown in this illustration.  [You **will not** have a "My Users" icon next to your profile **unless** you have been issued a "Payment Code" that provides you unlimited access to the system.]     

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/uhYbA8H.jpg)


Then click on "Add Customer" as shown in this illustration.  Type in your student's email address as shown in this illustration.

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/M3YkCSz.jpg)

Your student's name will appear next to their email address after you click on "Add Customer" on the right side of the illustration only if they have completed their profile.  Otherwise, only their email address will appear.

If your student's name or email address does not appear at the top of your client list, use the "Search Email" icon to type in your student's email and it will appear at the top.

**Note: To do their Stance Widths, click on the Green Icon next to their email address** In order to do Grip Size Measurements, you will need to complete a higher Certification Level.

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/wIELCrX.jpg)


There are 5 Measurements used to determine the Stance Widths that recruit each of the 9 Core Regions.  Height, Weight, Shoe Size as reported by your student & Shoulder Width & Body Width measured by you, the Wright Balance®  Professional.

Before using the Body Calipers, measure the width between the 2 rods at their narrowest (closed) to be certain you are reading the correct measurement line on the Calipers as I am doing with a yardstick in the illustration below.

 ![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/6qulXfh.jpg)
 
**Shoulder Width:**  Be certain that the body calipers are tight.  Each yellow rod has a screw nut.  Tighten the nut on the body calipers before measuring each student.
 
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/XI5W0bc.jpg)


**Body Width:** The metal base of the body caliper should be touching your students back when you do the measurements.  Keep asking your student:  **"Can you barely feel that on both sides?"** as you do the measurements. Repeat the measurements twice.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/03dqFeS.jpg)

This video will guide you through how to do the body measurements.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vAhq0VjXq9U?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 
**The measurements you do are extremely important** to determine the ideal setup for your student.  You will have several different strategies to validate your measurements.  

Input the body measurements on the web page as shown in the illustration below. 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/hJIu09w.jpg)

The Results are immediately emailed to you.  Note: This illustration presents the results for LPGA Legends Tour Player Laurie Rinker.  These results are specific to Laurie's body measurements and will be different for every player measured.  Additionally, you will note that Laurie's results start with Middle Core Stance Widths.  In the most recent revision the results email begins with Lower Core Stance Widths followed by Middle and Upper Core Stance Widths.  Please note that change the first time you use the system.    
 
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/vhvRfda.jpg)

**Use  only the first 3 Stance Widths as circled in the example below for each Core Region to Map the Core.**   The most recent version of the results shows the first 3 stance widths in each Core Region in **Bold Type**.  You will also note that the Lower Core Results appear first.


 
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/2NBZpY4.jpg)

Notice the **Numbered** Core Regions in this illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/WiQscJ6.jpg)

Now, look at the **First Stance Width** in the **Lower Core Results**.   That **Stance Width** is **Number 1** and recruits the lowest part of the Core, the pelvic floor.  Note that the Lower Core is Color coded Blue.  **If** the first Stance Width in the **Lower Core Results** is **28 inches**, mark the yardstick **Blue # 1** at the **28 inch** mark as shown in this illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/s4R65R0.jpg) 

The number 2 means that **Stance Width** **Recruits** the **Region** of the **Core** exactly between the **Navel** and the Pelvic Floor as shown in this illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/yUXAliH.jpg)

**If** the **Second Stance Width** in the **Lower Core Results** is **12 inches**, mark the yardstick with a **Blue** pen at the **12 inch mark** and write the **number 2** above the **12 inch mark** as shown in the following illustration.  

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/tMrqLUc.jpg)

**If** the **Third Stance Width** in the **Lower Core Results** is **23 inches**, mark the yardstick with a **Blue** marker at the **23** inch mark and put the **number 3** **above** the **23 inch** mark as shown in the following illustration.  The **number 3** means that **Stance Width** **Recruits** the **Region** of the **Core** just below the **Navel**.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/s4R65R0.jpg)



![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/jBG0W7k.jpg)
 
You are going to use a **Black Marker** for the **Middle Core** Stance Widths for the **first 3 numbers** of the **Middle Core Results** you are emailed.  The **first Stance Width** will be **numbered 4**, the **second numbered 5** & and the **third Stance Width** **numbered 6****.   Note the corresponding numbered Regions of the Core.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/OB6Beoq.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/s4R65R0.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/tMrqLUc.jpg)

The **Upper Core Results** should be recorded on the yardstick using a **Red Marker**.  The first **3 Stance Widths** of the **Upper Core Results** recruit the **3** **Regions** of the **Upper Core**.  

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/P3vntkd.jpg)

You will take the first Stance Width of the Upper Core Results and number it **7**, the second Stance Width and number it **8** and the third Stance Width from your Upper Core results and number it **9**.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/tMrqLUc.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/s4R65R0.jpg)


Transfer the first 3 Stance Widths [shown in **Bold Type** in the results] from each Core Region (Lower, Middle & Upper-- 9 Total) to a measurement tool you will use to "test" and  determine the **Dominant Core Region**. 

#**Review: How to Use the Results to Mark a Yardstick **

Color Code the Stance Widths by Core Region with:

**Blue = The first 3 Stance Widths listed in the Lower Core Results.  Number those Stance Widths Regions 1, 2 & 3 respectively.**
 
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/yUXAliH.jpg)

**Black= Middle Core Stance Widths (Regions 4, 5 & 6)**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/OB6Beoq.jpg)

**Red=  Upper Core Stance Widths  (Regions 7, 8 & 9)**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/P3vntkd.jpg)

 
Note the Color Coding and Numbering on the Paper Yardstick in the following illustration.  The Color Coding and Numbering are Universal for Wright Balance Professionals.  It will also help your student and you determine their Dominant Core Region during the testing.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/DGvShxL.jpg)

**NOTE:** If you use the Grip Size Application in **Level 2** of Certification, you will need to know the exact Core Region by number (1-9) that is Dominant.

You will also need to provide your student with their Stance Width measurements on a yardstick or similar tool like the one in the illustration above for use at home to do their WB Core 360 Exercise Program.

#**Tests for Core Symmetry**

You will be able to validate the results you just determined from the measurements using multiple strategies from the process that follows.  Evidence based instruction is the fastest way to move your students to success through **Guided Discovery**.  Practice on Friends and Family before you work with a student using this model.


Each of us has **only** one of our 9 Core Regions where we have strength.  This Single Core Region is recruited by a Stance Width that only repeats **twice** in **30 inches**. The observed mobility and  strength in that one Stance Width is a result of **Core Symmetry**. When your student assumes the Stance Width that creates Symmetry, they will have maximum mobility & strength.  This video will provide you with 3 strategies to determine your student's Dominant Core Region.  There are several other strategies for determining the exact Core Region toward the end of this EBook.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nOlml7fCpC4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


As shown in that video, Core Symmetry keeps the clubface square as long as you are testing from your student's single Dominant Core Region & your student has maximum strength only in that single Stance Width of Core Dominance.  


This video shows a beginner testing his clubface from different Core Regions after the Core Exercises.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4f8iohgfkYI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 

When your student does not have Core Symmetry, their core muscles will tighten on one side, their pelvis will rotate left or right and their imbalance will be expressed at ground level as shown in these illustrations and the clubface will open or close.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/zpGblx2.jpg)   

These illustrations (above and below) represent what you will see in your student in 8 out of the 9 Stance Widths from the results.  Both of these illustrations  will impact club and putter path and your students ability to rotate in the backswing and/or downswing.  These set up / swing positions will also impact the stability of their Core Muscles and, over time, result in soreness, stiffness, pain and injury.  I will cover all of the factors that create these balance positions in the Advanced Certification Levels.
  
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/pBaqD7G.jpg)

When you have found your Students Dominant Core Region, you will note their hips are square with the blue bar and bungee.  **It is important that your student understands the importance of their hips being square at address.** As you will see, changes in hip line are indicative of Core Tension, an opening or closing clubface, an errant club path and an elevated chance of injury.

If your Student's Dominant Core Region is Lower Core, their Stance Balance will look like the illustrations below.  Note that the straight Line of Force is over the Center of the arches.    

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/fCSqoiw.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/iACtBH9.jpg)

If their Dominant Core Region is Middle Core, their Stance Balance will look like the illustrations below.  Note that the straight Line of Force is just behind the balls of the feet and forward of the Center of the arches.    

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/GAy2lWT.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/3in6Tq8.jpg)

If their Dominant Core Region is Upper Core, their Stance Balance will look like the illustrations below.  Note that the straight Line of Force is over  the balls of the feet.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/PvzXzAq.jpg)

#**Does your student need to proceed further in their assessment and instruction?**

If you are assessing a beginner or a once a month golfer who wants no lessons, your job might be finished.  I would encourage you to send them the Ebook Link that matches their tested Dominant Core Region and markas shown below:

Lower Core Players:

http://online.fliphtml5.com/azhq/lgmb/#p=1

Middle Core:

http://online.fliphtml5.com/azhq/zejo/#p=1

Upper Core:

http://online.fliphtml5.com/azhq/dtvr/#p=1

I would also set them up with an alignment stick with their playing stance widths marked from their Wright Balance Stance Width Results for their Dominant Core Region.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/6gVwwQy.jpg)

I would encourage you to provide your student with the first 3 Stance Widths of their measured Dominant Core Region to create Symmetry within that Core Region.  

Set up their 3 Stance Widths from their results on a yardstick or similar permanent measurement tool as shown in this illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/tQEY3Gm.jpg) 

Note in the illustration above that these yardsticks are from 3 different players.  They will use only one of these yardsticks to do an exercise program in the 3 Stance Widths specific to their Dominant Core Region. 

#**Initial Exercise to Create Symmetry in all Dominant Core Region Stance Widths**

You are going to have your students do a 3 minute exercise and illustrate why.  If they have not already, have them hit 15 to 20 balls from their Dominant Core Region Stance Widths using the alignment stick or similar measurement tool you marked with their Stance Widths.

After hitting 15 to 20 balls, it is time to have them do a brief exercise.

[**Always** ask your students about Head, Neck, Shoulder, Wrists, Back, Hip, Knee and Foot injuries.  Inquire about surgeries, illness, pain and stiffness. Advise your student that the exercises are gravity driven and they should have no stress on the body unless their is a known or unknown pre-existing condition.  **PLEASE** advise your student that they should do no exercise without consulting their physician.  Any exercise regimen that is done is at their own risks. ]

These exercises are illustrated in the following pages.  Here are videos providing a brief summary of the exercises to provide your student.  The first are Obliques as shown in this video.  Obliques take care of left to right balance.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rHlzYyvWNKo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If your student follows the Oblique Exercise with 10 Wall push-ups in the ***3 Stance Widths of their Dominant Core Region*** as shown in the following video, Their Core will be square  in all of the 6 to 8 Stance Widths of their Dominant Core Region from their results page.   As long as they play from those 6 to 8 Stance Widths of their Dominant  Core Region.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KD89rbn5PKU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This video was shown earlier in Level 1.  It also illustrates the importance of doing Planks at least in the 3 Stance Widths of their Dominant or Playing Core Region.

#**Balance by Core Region**

Once you have given your student the exercises for their Core Region, it is important that you provide them with an illustration of where they will feel their balance at address.

 **Is Your Student Able to Play From a Measured Dominant Region of Lower or Middle Core?**

We have found that a player's ability to play from a Middle or Lower Core measured Dominant Core Region is determined by one measurement.  That measurement is the **Carrying Angle** or **Power Angle.** Dr. Michael Mellman introduced the **Carrying Angle**  to the original research setting.  It was a standard measurement we did on all of the subjects in Dr. Frank Jobe's biomechanics lab.  The **Carrying Angle** is the medical term of this measurement from 1865 medicine.  

*Golf Magazine* Editor, David Denunzio,  changed the term "**Carrying Angle**" to **Power Angle** in a 2010 article:  ***The Power of Angles***.  We continue to use the term **Power Angle** to this day as it determines the player's ability to apply force and recruit Power from the ground in their swing.   It is also the angle of Range of Motion for a person depending on their Stance width.  As you will see, this Angle shows up in numerous places in set up and during the swing when Core Symmetry is set correctly at address.

This photo is of Dr. Mellman demonstrating the Carrying Angle on the range in the  1990s.  Notice the "**Asymmetry**" of Dr. Mellman's left and right arms as they extend different distances from his sides.  (This is the same **Asymmetry** we see prior to the Wright Balance Core 360 Exercises.)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/TCBDfUt.jpg)

This illustration shows how the **Power Angle** measurement was done in the original study.  Notice how "shallow" this angle appears in J R Ruda, one of our amateur subjects in the lab.  In the original study, we measured the **Power Angle** in one Stance Width.

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/1XWtnl8.jpg)

We now measure the **Power Angle** from different Core Region Stance Widths, up the forearm and 90 degrees to the ground as shown in the illustration below.  The key to this measurement is knowing that every Core Region has a different **Power Angle.**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/gMuMI41.jpg)

The **Power Angle** in Upper Core Stance Widths always measures more "shallow" than the Middle or Lower Core Stance Width.  The Lower Core Stance Width will always measure the largest Angle.  That statement should be qualified noting that the **Power Angle** will measure the same in the left and right arm in all Stance Widths by Core Region only after the Wright Balance Core 360 Exercises.  Below is an illustration of a Power Angle before (bottom) and after (top) the Wright Balance Core 360 Exercise. Note the Symmetry in the Top photo.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/HPOEiya.jpg) 
 
I am going to show you how to do the measurement and then how to "test" your student's ability to set this angle in their trail arm in their downswing.   Your student's ability to set their trail arm in the downswing is directly related to their **External Shoulder Rotation** in their Dominant Core Region.  Their **External Shoulder Rotation** is exactly the same as their **Power Angle** and changes by Core Region.  First, let's look at how to do the measurement.

Ask your student to assume their Dominant Core Region Stance Width.  That is the Stance Width where you determined your student had Core Symmetry with maximum Power / Strength.   That is the only Stance Width where their left and right arms will measure the same.  You are primarily interested in their "trail arm".  That is their right arm if they are swinging from the right side.  ***If*** your student test to be an **Upper Core Player**, the measurement to determine their trail arm position isn't necessary **UNLESS** for some reason you are changing them to a Lower Core Player. 

You will use a digital protractor as shown in the following illustration.  Always do this measurement as you will use their Carrying / Power Angle result at numerous points in your student's setup. 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/zvnu1Wr.jpg)

Open the digital protractor.  Note that one end is a thin metal bar and the other is the main body of the protractor with a bubble in the middle. Hold the protractor in your left hand and **gently** take your students right wrist and rotate their arm so their palm is facing forward as shown in this photo illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/2ElYWOF.png)

Set the protractor arm without the "bubble"  down the middle of their forearm as shown here.  Adjust the upper bar of the digital protractor until the bubble centers indicating that bar is 90 degrees to the ground.  Note the angle on the digital readout.  Measure the **Power Angle** again to be certain you get the same measurement.  

This video shows changes by Core Region in LPGA and Legends Tour Player Laurie Rinker.  Each of us has changes in our Power Angle by Core Region.

This video shows how the Power Angle relates to the trail arm position in the downswing by Core Region, how it varies between players and how to determine if it fits your student's dominant Core Region.

 <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihNv7yS8Mdk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The Lower Core Player needs to have enough External Shoulder Rotation to "seat" their trail elbow inside their hip as shown here in Lower Core Player Dustin Johnson at the top of the swing.  Note the difference in the trail arm position in Lower Core Player Dustin Johnson, Middle Core Player Ernie Els and Upper Core Player Patrick Reed.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/Cs9lVTK.jpg)

The impact position of Lower Core Player Dustin Johnson shows his trail arm elbow at impact.  He has an "Under Delivery."  In order to have an under delivery, Your Carrying / Power Angle must "match" an Under Delivery / right elbow position.  Note the difference in his trail arm position when compared to the trail arms of Middle Core Player Jason Day and Upper Core Player Patrick Reed.  

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/i0dRKXa.jpg)

In order for Dustin Johnson to "seat" his trail arm elbow as he does in this illustration, he must be in a Lower Core Stance Width that produces the maximum External Shoulder Rotation of his trail arm.

 **The Carrying Angle is Always the Same Angle as the External Shoulder Rotation By Core Region Stance Width**


 <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihNv7yS8Mdk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Assume, for example, a player like Jai test for  their Dominant Core as Lower.  However, their trail arm does not match their Core Region as you saw in the video above.  The image below is from the video.  It shows Jai in a dominant Core Stance Width and a very "shallow" (158 degrees) Carrying / Power Angle.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/Lui6XUF.jpg)

The illustration below shows that Jai's external shoulder rotation measures exactly the same as his Lower Core  Carrying / Power Angle. 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/cpDrvVJ.jpg)

This Angle is not great enough to set his right elbow (trail arm) inside his right hip where it  needs to be in the downswing.     

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/GEcspuI.jpg)

Our preliminary observations suggest that a Lower Core player must have a Carrying / Power Angle of at least 153 degrees in a Lower Core Stance Width to set the trail arm inside the right hip.  Even with a Carrying / Power Angle of at least 153 degrees, I would still encourage you to test any measurement.  

Test your student's trail arm by having them assume a Lower or Middle Core Stance Width, whatever their Dominant Core Stance Width. Set the external shoulder rotation as I am doing in this illustration...

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/gWlhhMf.jpg)

...then have them bring their trail arm elbow straight down to their side to determine where their elbow seats as I have done in these illustrations.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/koLn32O.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/6pY8sXp.jpg)

Note that my trail arm seats inside my right hip.  My Carrying / Power Angle is 151 degrees.   I am a Lower Core Player.   This means I am fine to play from any of my Wright Balance results for my Lower Core Stance Widths.  

#**What to Do if the Lower Core Player's Trail Arm Does Not Seat Inside the Right Hip** 

If your student test as a Dominant Lower Core Player but they are unable to seat their trail arm elbow inside their hip, they will not be able to play from Lower Core Stance Widths.  I would encourage you to move them to play from their Middle or Upper Core using the first 3 Stance Widths of the Middle or Upper Core results.   Use the Plank exercise as demonstrated in the content that follows for those 3 Stance Widths. 


#**WHY?**

If you measure your students Carrying / Power Angle in another Core Region Stance Width, the Angle of their left and right arms will be different and you will get different external rotation measurements due to the "Asymmetry" of their 
Carrying / Power Angle.  After the exercise using the first 3 Stance Widths of their Middle  or Upper Core Region Stance Widths, their Power / Carrying Angle will be the same on both the left and right sides.  They will need to be certain they do the Obliques exercise and Plank the 3 Stance Widths from their playing Core Region, even if it is not their measured Dominant Core Region.   If they are doing the Wright Balance Core 360 exercises, their playing Core Region is part of that total exercise program.

Once you have identified your student's Dominant Core Region and check their external shoulder rotation to determine the region they will play from, use the Stance Widths in their results ***from that Region*** for pracrtice and play.  For example, if you determine that their external shoulder Rotation fits best for  a Upper Core Player, use the stance widths from their Upper Core Results. (**Note** In the illustration below, the revised results page starts with **Lower Core Stance Widths**.)

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/NDi5HeL.jpg)
 
Mark your students Dominant Core Region Stance Widths from the results page on an alignment stick, a yardstick or similar aid your student can use to practice as shown in the following illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/6gVwwQy.jpg) 

Your student will have between 6 to 8 Stance Widths to play from.  Remember, your Upper Core players have a narrower stance than the Middle and Lower Core Players.  The Lower Core Players have the widest stance.


#**How Often Do You Need to Remeasure Your Student?**

Your Juniors should be remeasured every 3 to 6 months.   If one of your students loses or gains 10 to 15 pounds, they should be remeasured.   If your student has completed their profile when they "joined" in their registration process, their results will be stored in your Wright Balance Files.  If you enter their email address, their Stance Width or Grip Size measurements results will appear, depending upon what you are measuring.

I have a student who tested strongest in her Lower Core and whose Carrying / Power Angle was 151 degrees.  Then, she gave birth.  A few months after giving birth she came in for a lesson.  Her Power Angle had changed to 163 degrees in all Core Regions, no change.  Not only did her posture have to change but also her Grip and Core Region.  She was able to move to a Middle Core Stance Width, change her Grip to Middle Core and how she set her Posture in one lesson with good results.  I should qualify that she has been a student for a number of years and she has watched the technology evolve.  Making the changes were relatively simple.  Her husband is an Upper Core Player and she understands the differences in Core Region set up, Posture and Grip.  The most salient point here is that her Power Angle changed after giving birth.
 

#**How Important is Core Symmetry to Play Well?**

**Stance Width** is the foundation of your students setup and swing.  Consistency, Power, Back and Joint Health are the more accurate descriptors of the foundation of Stance Width. When your students are in the proper Stance Width, they are ready to build their setup in alignment, Grip and Posture.  Grip makes up about 70% of the set up.  However, as you will see in subsequent levels of Certification, the Grip must match the Core Region Stance Width.

In general, your students will "perform"  for the immediate consequences.  It is simple to demonstrate the importance of Stance Width in a "hands on" **Guided Discovery** Exercise.  Set your student up in their ideal Stance width and show them the orientation of their clubface when the shaft is parallel to the ground and they are standing tall.  


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRRU57F7pys?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Then change their Stance Width and note the clubface aim is left or right.  From a standing position, their clubface will be square in one of their dominant Core Region Stance Widths.  When they step to another Core Region Stance Width, their clubface will open or close.  

 The Wright Balance Core 360 Exercise Program will balance your Student's Core from the roof of their mouth to their pelvic floor.  They will have greater consistency and distance on the golf course and practice.  

If, e.g., your student measures to be a Lower Core Player but, when tested, but they don't have enough external shoulder rotation to set their trail arm inside their hip in their downswing, they will need to move to a Middle or Upper Core Region to play.   Their grip will be consistent with their playing Core Region and the clubface will remain constant through the swing in all of their "new" Core Region Stance Widths.  In summary, they will have greater consistency, power and they are less likely to be injured if they do the Oblique exercise and planks in their 3 Stance Widths from their "new" chosen Core Region.  

Generally speaking, the stronger the Core from top to bottom, the better overall Core health, strength and mobility.   With a well balanced Core it is less likely there will be overuse of some muscles of the Core and under use of others creating isolated muscle fatigue and rising injury potential with repeated physical stress.

The reality is that you will have some students who want to exercise and integrate the Core 360 exercises into their daily routine.  You will also have students who have no desire to exercise.  I have experienced all of the possible scenarios.  Most don't want to exercise unless they experience increased pain relief and mobility.  If that is the case, I show them what will happen to the clubface and their power through the swing if they don't exercise.  To play Consistently and with Power, all they need to do is the 3 Stance Widths in the Core Region they are going to use when they play and the Obliques exercise . (**Guided Discovery**)  It will take about 3 or 4 minutes if they do wall pushups in the 3 Stance Widths plus the Obliques.  If they do all 9 Core Regions and the back of the Core and Obliques, the exercise session will take about 10 to 12 minutes.  Demonstrate this to them.  Some of your students will still not do the Wright Balance Exercises.  It is obviously your choice.  When they show up complaining of poor ball striking, watch them hit balls.  Then have them do the Core Exercise.  The results will be night and day.  They always are.  Then perhaps you can get them to do the Planks using the first 3 Stance Widths of their results of the Core Region they are going to play from.   

As noted, our research shows your student can get away with the Wall Push-up Planking exercises in the 3 Stance Widths of the Core Region from which they are going to play.  Afterwards, they must be in one the 5 to 7 Stance Widths from that Core Region.  The 3 Stance Widths they planked cover all of the Core area of those 5 to 7 Stance Widths.   

It is important to note that, after the WB Core 360 Exercise Program, in each Core Region (Upper, Middle & Lower) Stance Widths that your student's hands will hang the same within the same Core Region Stance Widths but their hands hang differently between Core Regions.   

At the very least, I would encourage you to expose your students to the impact the WB Core 360 Exercise program has on their body.  Increased Distance and reduced pain with increased mobility are just a few of the benefits.

My personal belief is that, if your student does only the exercise for the their Dominant Core Region and not the 6 other Stance Widths, their Core will be weak in the other 6 regions.  As long as they play from one of the 5 to 7 Stance Widths from their results within their Dominant Core Region, their performance will be improved.  However, they will be increasing their potential for injury away from the Golf Course as well as on the Course.  Consider the 9 Regions of your Core as a series of links in a chain.  The Chain will "break" at its weakest link.  Regardless, we are a society that wants immediate gratification.  Injury prevention through exercise is not immediate gratification.

**Guided Discovery**:  Again, I would have your student set up with the alignment or yardstick marked with the Stance Widths from their Dominant Core Region (like the illustration below) and hit balls before and after the WB Core 360 Exercise program.  It would be helpful if you have a launch monitor or similar measurement system and compare the before and after.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/6gVwwQy.jpg)

Be sure the alignment or yardstick is on their toe line when they are hitting balls.  Many players move the measurement stick a foot or so away from their feet.  When the stance width stick is not on the toe line,  your student will perceive that their stance width is in balance when it is not.  One inch will make a difference in ball striking.

If you do nothing more in your first lesson, I would encourage you to have your student do the wall push-up planks from the 3 Stance Widths of the   Core Region in which they plan to play.  Again, I also have them hit balls prior to their exercise with their alignment stick on the ground to be certain we eliminate the variable of Stance Width.  Then, I have them do **10 Wall Push-ups** **using only** the **3 Stance Widths** from the **Core Region in which they are going to play. **  I immediately have them hit balls again. (**Guided Discovery**) The results will be night and day.  Ball striking after the Wall Planks in the 3 Playing Core Region Stance Widths will be far superior to the prior to planking ball striking.  Through this **Guided Discovery** They will understand how important the Dominant Core Exercise is for performance in those 3 Stance Widths.  The 3 Stance Widths they use for the wall planks will cover all of the Stance Widths from their Dominant Core Region. 

Subsequently, you can introduce the Wright Balance Core 360 Exercise Program if they are inclined to do the exercise.  Back Pain and Soreness that is based in their soft tissue will likely resolve and that will be a motivation to do the full Wright Balance Core 360 exercise program.  

 
#Why do the exercises in only their playing core region enable a student to play? 

The 3 Dominant Core Region Stance Widths used to do the Wall Planks recruited one-third of your student's Core.  When they finish that 2 minute exercise, their hips will be square in the 7 - 9  stance widths from their Playing Core Region results, but not in the other Core Regions.  Their shoulders will be level and their hands will hang the same only in their Dominant Core Region Stance Widths.  


#**Exercises that Create Symmetry One Core Region at a Time**

As noted before, **Always** ask your students about Head, Neck, Shoulder, Wrists, Back, Hip, Knee and Foot injuries.  Inquire about surgeries, illness, pain and stiffness. Advise your student that the exercises are gravity driven and they should have no stress on their body unless their is a known or unknown pre-existing condition.  **PLEASE** advise your student that they should do no exercise without consulting their physician.  Any exercise regimen that is done is at their own risks. 


#**Oblique Exercises for Left to Right Balance**

 Oblique Exercises create Left to Right Balance.   The **Oblique Exercise** should be done before the Plank and Back Exercises.  When the Obliques are done first, you will have Left to Right Balance when you do the Plank and Back Exercise.  This left to right balance will create a more even distribution of Force when you are doing the front and back Core Exercises.

Before doing the Obliques, bend forward with no knee flex, make a fist & point your thumbs toward each other.  Notice that they only line up **exactly the same** in one of the 9 Stance Widths.  However, one hand is Lower than the other when you point your thumbs toward each other as shown in the following illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/68V9FqH.jpg)

The Oblique Exercises are done with the feet together while leaning against a wall at a comfortable distance.  Be certain that your students spine is in a straight line.  You may have to adjust their spine line as shown in this illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/NCssxEb.jpg)

Your student should hold this position to tolerance or for 1 minute, whichever is greater.  Ideally, the goal is to have your student hold this position for 1 minute on both their left and right sides.  This photo shows the left side plank.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/NjO0uWY.jpg)
 
Your student's thumbs will be the same height in all 9 Stance Widths after the Oblique exercise.  This left to right balance correction has implications for everything from putter to driver. 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/E1xbfmr.jpg)

However, their hands will only be the same distance from their thighs (due to an open or closed hip line) in their Dominant Core Region Stance Widths.  The following video demonstrates the Oblique exercise at the 4'50" mark.

#**Frontal Core Symmetry Through Planking**

This segment covers several strategies for accomplishing **Frontal Core Symmetry**.  If you look at the body from the side with a line dividing the front and back of the person,  the front side of the body is the Front of the Core.  The back side of the body is the Back of the Core.  The Oblique exercises address the sides of the Core.  This segment of exercises will balance the Front of your student's Core, thus you will create **Frontal Core Symmetry.**  There are many different exercise methods to create **Frontal Core Symmetry**.  I will cover most of them here.  

**Jaw Line Symmetry**

**Guided Discovery:**  Before having your student set up to Plank each Stance Width, ask them to note their Jaw Line Symmetry (or lack thereof) in their 3 Core Regions.  Prompt them to notice that when they place their feet on their **Region 9** Upper Core Stance Width that their "Bite" moves forward and their teeth touch on one side only.   [**When doing this test, remind your student to gently bring their teeth together.**]   

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/woBXDR6.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/010lvL0.jpg)

Next, ask them to place their feet in their **Region 1** (Pelvic Floor) Stance Width from their Lower Core Results.  Prompt them to notice that their bite moves toward the back of their mouth & their teeth touch only on the left or right side, unless that Stance Width is their Dominant Core Stance Width. Their teeth should just be touching, not a firm bite, to experience this phenomena.

Lastly, ask them to move to **Region 5** **Middle Core** Stance Width and notice that when they gently bring their teeth together they touch in the middle.  This exercise is a validation of the vertical changes in **Core Symmetry** by Stance Width and it will get your student's attention with regard to the accuracy of the Stance Width measurements.  

**Why do the Jaw Symmetry Exercise at all?**  Teaching is belief conversion.  **Guided Discovery** is one of the fastest ways to convert a student.  This is an exercise in body awareness that will validate the Wright Balance Technology for them.  The more anxious a student is in the learning environment, the less likely they will be able to experience their jaw symmetry.  This is not a "mandatory" exercise for them but it will show them the subtlety of the technology, give them body awareness and give you their attention as you move forward. 

 This video demonstrates how to create **Symmetry** in the **Front** part of the **Core**.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_QEKtiTaMLg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You can create **Frontal Symmetry** doing Knee, Full, Wall **Planks,** or Push-up Wall **Planks** using each of the 9 Core Region Stance Widths as shown in the following illustrations. (Note:  Again, your Student should not **Plank** if they have any issues with their Neck, Shoulder, Wrists, Elbows, Knees, or untreated Herniated Disc or similar physical issue.)  You will note that **Core Symmetry** is created in one **Core Region** at a time with the **Planking** Exercise.  
 
  ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/anlz9KR.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/NXaig5H.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/58YeVzl.jpg)

If you student is able to do	Push-up Wall Planks, the breathing  and dynamic motion will increase  oxygenation to the muscles being recruited.  The wall push-ups will take the least amount of time.  When you can shorten the exercise process with something like push-up wall planks, it will make the Core Exercises more palatable for your students.  **All combined, the entire exercise process will take about 10 to 12 minutes**  

If your student is unable to do the Push-up Wall Planks, they may use the gravity of their body weight and lean against the wall or use the floor as shown for 30 seconds in each of the 9 Core Region Stance Widths.  The long term goal should be to hold the static wall or floor planks in each of the 9 Core Regions for 1 minute. 

This video shows the same Core Exercises using the floor for those students who are unable to use the wall due to shoulder, arm or leg / foot issues.

#**Back of the Core Symmetry** 
 
The following back exercise will create **Back of the Core Symmetry**.

Ask your student to recline on their back and raise their knees.  Raising the knees flattens the back during the exercise.  **This raised knee position is necessary for each of the back exercises.** 

The first exercise is to raise one leg at a time (Opposite Legs) to a count of 20.  

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/cMKRAKW.jpg)

The second exercise is to raise one arm at a time (Opposite Arms) to a count of 20.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/i0jk8rx.jpg)

The Last exercise is Right Arm Left Leg then Left Arm Right Leg to a count of 20 (10 on each side).

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/4vFFG7I.jpg)

This video will demonstrate the importance of the Back Exercise Program that is part of the Wright Balance®  Core 360 exercise program. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TzdfsaW4XJM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

#**Balance by Core Region**

**Guided Discovery**
Following the exercise, put the blue bar secured with the bungee flat on your student's hips.  Ask them to note that their hips are square in every Stance Width.  If they are standing tall on a **Lower Core** Stance Width, their Balance will look similar to this illustration.  Ask them where they feel their weight is as they stand tall.  (Note:  It is natural for your student to move forward in response to moving toward their heels.  Ask them to stand tall and relax and notice where they settle.) 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/fCSqoiw.jpg)

If your student is standing tall in a Middle Core Stance Width they will describe a balance sensation similar to the illustration below, just behind the balls of the feet and forward of the center of the arches.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/GAy2lWT.jpg)

When they move to an Upper Core Stance Width, standing tall, they will describe a sensation of being over the balls of their feet as shown in the following illustration.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/PvzXzAq.jpg)

 **Guided Discovery**
After your student does the WB Core 360 Exercise Program, have them change Stance Widths from Lower  to  Middle to Upper Core Regions marked on their Planking Measurement Tool.  Your goal is to show your students the changes in balance as they move through Stance Widths recruiting different Core Regions.
  
The **Lower Core** Player is **Balanced** over the center of their arches from a Lower Core Stance Width.  Have your student step to a Lower Core Stance Width and add knee flex.  They should describe their weight moving over the center of their arches as shown in the illustration below.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/g8d3FeJ.jpg)

The **Middle Core** Player is **Balanced** just behind the balls of their feet and just forward of the center of the arches.  Have your student step to a Middle Core Stance Width and add knee flex.  They should describe a feeling of their weight move just behind the balls of their feet and just forward of the center of their arches as shown in the illustration below.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/OXxiUk5.jpg)

The **Upper Core** Player is **Balanced** over the balls of their feet.  Have your student step to a Middle Core Stance Width and add knee flex.  They should describe their weight moving over the balls of their feet as shown in the illustration below.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/GArIg6e.jpg)

How you set your **Posture** is the 2nd of the 4 variables that set the ideal balance for each of these **Core Regions**.  The other 3 variables are **Stance Width,** **Grip** & **Grip Size**


Again, once your student has completed the WB Core 360 Exercises, provide them with a measurement tool with all of their Dominant Core Region Stance widths marked similar to the illustration below.  The 9 Core Region Stance Widths are for determining your student's Dominant Core Region and then their WB Core 360 Exercise Program.

The alignment stick in the illustration below is marked with all of the Stance Widths from their Dominant Core Region they will use to practice and play.
 
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/6gVwwQy.jpg)  



#**Stretching Your Core From Top to Bottom**

Set your left knee on "0" and and your right knee on Core Region 1.  Move to each of the 9 Stance Widths (1 through 9) using the width of your knees (as shown in the illustration below), you can stretch each Core Region by crawling out slowly with your finger tips, not  too far, just to a comfortable distance so you feel a stretch.  If your student does that stretch in each of the 9 Core Regions, they will describe a comfortable, relaxed back sensation upon completion of the exercise.  This exercise should only be done after the WB Core 360 exercises are completed.

•	Child's Pose x 9 Core Regions by **Width** of your **Knees**

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/UR6ehey.jpg)



#**Other Test of Core Symmetry Before & After the Wright Balance Core 360 Exercises** 

There are numerous ways to determine your student's Dominant Core Region.  The following are some of the things you can demonstrate to your student for improved overall health and mobility as well as those who question the technology.  

• Overall recurring soft tissue soreness and pain will begin to remit with the Wright Balance (WB) Core 360 Exercise Program.  Decreased back soreness, stiffness and pain after practice and play are the most common reports from those doing the WB Core 360 Exercises on a daily basis.

•  Their shoulder height will level out immediately following the WB Core 360 Exercises.  These illustrations show the before and after exercise shoulder height.

**Before:**   Notice Justin's right Shoulder is Lower than his left.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/ZMNOV3R.jpg)

**After:** Notice how level his shoulders are Following the Core 360 Exercise.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/weSmNz6.jpg)


•	Arms / Hands hang at your Student's side:  You will notice that in all but one of the 9 Stance Widths that one hand turns in more than the other prior to the WB Core 360 Exercises (left photo below.)  Note that after the WB Core 360 Exercises the arms and hands hang exactly the same (right photo below.)

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/qrL4MzA.jpg)

**Guided Discovery**:  Have your student stand tall after they have completed the WB Core  360 Program and note that their hands hang at their side exactly the same.   Tell them to slightly rotate their hips left or right and note how one hands turns in more than the other.  Their balance line will look something like the following when the hands do not hang the same.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/4pdhKWj.jpg) 

When the arms and hands hang the same, the Balance Line of Force at ground level  looks something like the following.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/GAy2lWT.jpg)

•	**Guided Discovery:**  Before the WB Core 360 Exercises, when you place the hip bar & bungee on your student's hips, they are parallel to a reference line at his feet in ***only 1 of the 9*** Stance Widths, the same Stance Width where their hands hang exactly the same at their side.  Put the bar & bungee on their hips after the WB Core 360 Exercises and show them that no matter what stance width they are in, the hip bar remains square.  The more you can Guide your student through the impact of the Core Exercises, the more compliant they will be in doing the exercise.  Be certain to explain to them the importance of a square hip line in playing.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/yFoTO69.png)

 

•	**Guided Discovery:**  Your student's Thumbs line up exactly the same in only 1 of the 9 Stance Widths.  In the other 8 Stance Widths, one of your student's hands is closer to one of his thighs than the other.   After the Wright Balance Core 360 Exercises, the thumbs line up in every Stance Width.   

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/zJNPHdg.jpg)


 • **Guided Discovery:**  You will note that one hand is lower than the other in all 9 Stance Widths.  However, your students hands will be pointing at each other and the same distance from their thighs in only 1 of the 9 Stance Widths.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/5p4CH2Q.jpg) 

Following the WB Core 360 Exercise, your students hands will be the same height in every Stance Width as shown in the illustration below.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/tknUB8z.jpg)
 
•**Guided Discovery:**  When your student relaxes their shoulder and lets their arms swing, their arms and hands will track precisely on line in only one of the 9 Stance Widths prior to the WB Core 360 Exercise Program.

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/o2XK60i.jpg)

•**Guided Discovery:**  When you pull on your students club head when they have assumed a very weak or strong grip, their clubface will open or close when extended in front or to the side in 8 of the 9 Core Region Stance Widths.  The clubface will remain square in the single Dominant Core Region  Stance Width of Core Symmetry.

Following the WB Core 360 Exercise Program, when the player grips the club with a square face in one of their Dominant Core Region Stance Widths, when you pull on the clubhead, the clubface will remain square in all of those Dominant Core Region Stance Widths but it will open or close in their non-dominant stance widths.

•  **Guided Discovery:**  When your student assumes a "neutral" grip in their 1 of 9 Stance Width of Core Symmetry where their hips are square, they have the greatest strength and their thumbs line up, and they bring the club parallel to the ground the clubface will be square.  When they step to any other Dominant Core Region Stance Width, the clubface will open or close.

Following the WB Core 360 Exercise Program, when the player grips the club with a square face in one of their Dominant Core Region Stance Widths, the clubface will remain square in all of those Dominant Core Region Stance Widths.

 However, that same grip will open or close when they step to a Non-Dominant Core Region Stance Width.

This video demonstrates this phenomena at the 7 minute mark:

•**Guided Discovery:** When your Student Closes their eyes & brings their hands together in front, their fingertips will meet exactly in only 1 of the 9 Stance Widths, their Dominant Core Region.   Following the WB Core 360 Exercise Program, your students fingertips will meet exactly the same in any Stance Width they assume whether it is in their Dominant Core Region or not. (Note: This test is sometimes used as a calibration in 3 D Motion capture.  Very few players will have Core Symmetry ---99% will not---and the calibration using this strategy will be inaccurate unless the player has done the WB Core 360 Exercise Program.)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/fUL8USK.jpg)   

Consider the following. If your students core is tighter on one side and their hips are rotated, their hands will not meet exactly the same when they bring them together in front.  To demonstrate this to your student after the WB Core 360 Exercise, have them test their hands position in front and note that their fingertips meet exactly in all stance widths.  Then ask them to subtlely rotate their hips in one direction and then bring their hands together.   Note that the greater the hip rotation, the more offset the fingertips are.     


•**Guided Discovery:**  When your student attempts to move laterally, they will feel "blocked" on one side in 8 of the 9 Core Region Stance Widths.  Following the WB Core 360 Exercise Program, they will have freedom of motion in both directions in all Stance Widths.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/eufdwg2.jpg)

You can visualize why they are blocked when you look at the balance configuration before and after the WB Core 360 Exercise Program.  Imagine trying to move laterally if your balance was as the illustration below.
 
![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/pBaqD7G.jpg) 

    
   
In the above example your student would be restricted when they try to move to their left.  After the WB Core 360 Exercise, as shown below, your student will have unrestricted movement in all directions.

•**Guided Discovery:**  When your student ***gently*** closes their mouth and they bring their teeth together, they will describe their teeth touching at the same time in only 1 of their 9 Stance Widths, their Dominant Core Region Stance Width.  In fact, you are able to predict for your student where their bite will meet by Core Region.  In the Upper Core Stance Widths, you will note that their "Bite" is forward and their teeth meet only on one side unless that is their Dominant Core Region Stance Width.  Similarly, when they step to a Lower Core Stance Width, their "Bite" will move to the back of their mouth and their teeth will touch only on one side unless that is their Dominant Core Region Stance Width.  This "Test" validates the Core Region Research for your student when you are able to predict their bite location simply by which Core Region Stance Width they are in.  Following the WB Core 360 Exercise Program, your students bite will be even regardless of Stance Width.

You may be asked why the Core Responds with changes in bite.  The answer to this question is easy to demonstrate following the WB Core 360 Exercise Program.   Have your student gently close their mouth and note the location (forward or back) of where there teeth meet.  Ask them to move their weight toward their toes and note that their bite moves forward, just as it did in one of their Upper Core Stance Widths.  Then ask them to move their weight toward their heels and note that their bite moves toward the back of their mouth as it did in their Lower Core Stance Widths.   As they settle into a "Centered" balance position, ask them to note that their bite  is in the middle of their mouth.   That exercise validates each of their 9 Core Region Stance Widths noting that their bite is consistent with Upper to Middle to Lower Core.

What about the left to right balance where your student's teeth touch only on one side prior to the WB Core 360 Exercise?  Following the WB Core 360 Exercise, ask your student to stand tall and note that their bite is even on both sides.  Then ask them to subtlely rotate their hips left or right and note that their bite "slides" to one side.  When the Core has symmetry, it is reflected in balance from the roof of the mouth to the pelvic floor.

•Your students vertical leap will increase following the WB Core 360 program. 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/Fd0bdhh.jpg)
 
**Guided Discovery:** After completing the WB Core 360,  stand in a comfortable Lower or Upper Core Stance Width and Jump.  Note the height of your jump. Then, slightly rotate your hips right or left and attempt to jump.  Imagine attempting to jump from a balanced Line of Force that opens or closes your hips.


   
•**Guided Discovery**:   Your Student will have Freedom of Motion to **Squat** in only one of their 9 Stance Widths, their Dominant Core Region.  Your Student will have Freedom of Motion to **Squat** in any Stance Width after 7 to 10 days of WB Core 360 Exercising.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/HPUoNRy.jpg)

Again, prior to the WB Core 360 Exercise, imagine attempting to squat in a balance configuration similar to the one in the illustration below.


![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/4pdhKWj.jpg) 

After the WB Core 360 exercise, your student will find that it is easier to set the line on the ball on the putting green or to squat in their garden or wherever it is necessary to Squat in their day to day life.  The illustration below illustrates why it is easier to squat.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/GAy2lWT.jpg)

**Guided Discovery:  How to Explain to your Student?**  After the WB Core 360 exercise, stand tall and Squat.  Notice the easy with which you squat.  To explain why it is easier to Squat to your student, very slightly increase the flex in your right knee.  When you increase the knee flex in your right knee, you will notice that your weight moves forward in your right foot and back in your left foot.  When you try to Squat against a balance position like the one you just created and notice that you will abruptly stop.  

Discuss with your student the stress put on your core and spine if they were to attempt to pick up a box from this position.  Given the right box weight and imbalance configuration, they will herniate a disc.   Discuss with your student the importance of the WB Core 360 Program for overall back health on and off the golf course.  If your student has had a back problem in the past, the "soft tissue" component of this back problem will resolve with the WB Core 360 Exercise Program.   
 
•	Shoulder Rotation:  You will note that your student has a restriction of shoulder rotation in 8 of the 9 Core Region Stance widths.  in their Dominant Core Region your student will have 90 degrees of rotation.  Following the WB Core 360 exercise, your student will have 90 degrees of shoulder rotation in every Stance Width.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/mAFwq34.jpg)

When your student attempts to rotate his shoulders from a balance configuration as the one below, he will always be restricted and in his golf swing and his path will follow his imbalance.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/4pdhKWj.jpg) 

 Following the WB Core 360, the change in balance frees the Core for Maximum rotation as illustrated below.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/GAy2lWT.jpg)  

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/HBEduIh.jpg)

**Guided Discovery:  How to Explain to your Student?**  After the WB Core 360 exercise, stand tall and notice how easy it is to rotate your shoulders from any Stance Width. Ask your student to increase the flex in their right knee slightly.  When they increase the knee flex in their right knee, they will notice that their weight moves forward in their right foot and back in their left foot.  When they try to rotate against a balance position like the one they just created and illustrated below, their shoulders will stop 90 degrees to the balance line or "Line of Force".  You can tell your student that when they swing from this position, there shoulders will stop and they will tend to lift the club to the top in their backswing.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/zpGblx2.jpg)

Similarly, if they setup with an increase flex in their left knee so that there is greater flexion than in their right knee, they will notice that their weight moves forward in their left foot and back in their right foot.  When they try to rotate against a balance position like the one just created and illustrated below, their shoulders will over rotate and stop 90 degrees to the balance line or "Line of Force".  When they attempt to rotate back in their downswing, they will note that their shoulders abruptly stop, again 90 degrees to their balance or "Line of Force".  You can tell your student that when they swing from this position, that they will over-swing, cross the line at the top and feel "stuck" or "handsy" in the downswing as their body stops.   

You may also mention to your student that either of these positions will create back pain over several weeks and months of playing and practicing from either of these balance configurations.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/pBaqD7G.jpg)

•	**Guided Discovery:**  Place the Hip bar and bungee on your student for this Discovery.  When your student pulls one foot straight back or steps forward, they will have a rotation of their pelvis ***prior to doing*** the WB Core 360 exercise program .

 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/sNUYvNU.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/4pdhKWj.jpg)

Following the WB Core 360 Exercise, when your student pulls one foot straight back or steps forward, they will have a square hip line and their hips will be square.  

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/PvzXzAq.jpg)



 ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/P8WWRKh.jpg)

Whether your student is walking or running, they will place less stress on the spine and have the greatest support for balance and Core Health in normal or extended activity.

 •**Guided Discovery-Separation of Upper & Lower Core:** Have your student lay on their back, keeping their shoulders flat on the floor and ask them to roll their lower core as far right and then left as far as they can without raising their shoulders from the floor.  Measure the distance the bottom knee is from the floor on both sides.   Every Golf swing requires separation of the Upper and Lower Core, either in the backswing or downswing. 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/qKNu8Jv.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/Xt9gzek.jpg)

Following the WB Core 360 Exercise Program, you will notice that their knees measure closer on both sides than in the pre-test.  If your student continues to do the WB Core 360 Exercise, they will be able to touch both sides of the floor in this test within 10 to 14 days if not sooner.

•**Guided Discovery-Vision Test by Stance Width Prior to & After Exercise:**  If you put a line on a ball and aim it at a toothpick using the WB Vision Board Test, your student will tell you that the line on the ball is left or right of the toothpick in 8 or the 9 Core Region Stance Widths.  From their Dominant Core Region Stance Widths they will tell you that the line on the ball visually intersects the toothpick. 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/y35g3G3.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/4i4wKe5.jpg)

Following the WB Core 360 Program, your student will tell you that the line on the ball is going to intersect the toothpick in all Stance Widths.   

Depending on your sport, you will find the same visual result using 5 or 6 baseballs with lines on them aimed down the middle of a plate as shown in these illustrations.  The player will see the line down the middle of the plate (without a bat) only in their Dominant Core Stance Width prior to the WB Core 360 Exercise.  Your student will describe seeing the ball moving inside or outside.  After completing the WB Core 360 Exercises, they will report visually seeing the ball down the middle of the plate.  Introduce a bat and the visual perception of the ball moves again inside or out.  We will cover bat size in the Level 2 of certification.

•The Carrying / Power Angle is not the same on the left and right arms in 8 out of the 9 Core Region Stance Widths as shown in these illustrations.   Note the balance configuration also relates to how your arms hang and the angle of your arms and distance to each side when you turn your palms forward.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/4pdhKWj.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/G722uB7.jpg)

After the Core 360 Exercise Program, the forearm angle (Carrying or Power Angle) will be the same on both sides due to changes in balance.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/GAy2lWT.jpg)

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/gMuMI41.jpg) 

**Guided Discovery:  How to Explain to your Student?**  After the WB Core 360 exercise, stand tall and rotate your forearms with your palms out as in the illustration above. You will note that they are the same distance from your hips on both sides. Then,  turn your hips slightly left or right and you will notice that the distance of your arms from your hips is greater on one side than the other.  That is the result of the observed hip rotation in your students.


•Your student will have the ability to resist force applied by you in only 1 of the 9 Core Region Stance Widths when that force is applied to a ball at the top of the Golf Swing.  **You may also use your student's hands clasped together and  apply force to their palms as they start their downswing**. (Wright Balance Professional and PGA Tour Veteran, Larry Rinker devised this test as an alternative to the ball test.) 

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/PJk1ZVR.jpg)

Your student will have the ability to resist force applied by you in only all 9 Core Region Stance Widths when that force is applied to a ball at the top of the Golf Swing.  

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/3znTgwq.jpg) 

After the **Guided Discovery** exercises, you will have convinced your students of the importance of the WB Core 360 Exercise Program to play with minimal compensations in their swing and for overall back health.  They will also pick up a half to full club in distance.  

They will verbalize intent to do the exercises at home.  You will need to provide your student with a measurement tool like the one in the illustration below for their daily home use.  All of your students will understand the importance of the WB Core 360 exercises.  Some players will do it, some won't.  Your juniors will tell you they will, but many will not.  When they show up for a lesson, some of your juniors will likely not have done the exercise.  ( all you have to do is have them stancd tall and relax.  If their hands hang the same at both sides, they exercised.  If one hand is turned in, they didn't do the the exercise.  Other students will do the exercises before practice and play.  If you don't ask about the WB Core 360 Exercise or any other "homework assignment" they were given, they will conclude it is not important.  Always ask about the homework you assigned.

#**The Learning Process**:  Backwards Chaining 

Learning takes place most efficiently in what is called **successive approximations**.  We learn "**Backwards**".  This learning process is called **Backwards Chaining**.  

For example, as infants, we learned to drink while a bottle was placed in our mouth.  We laid passively and drank.  Over days and months we began to grasp the bottle with both hands, eventually reaching for it as it was brought to our mouth.  Then we eventually held the bottle on our own and ultimately, we were able to pick up the bottle and drink without assistance.  The "sealed" bottle went to a cup (with a few accidents) and finally by age 6 or 7 we were able to drink from many different types of glasses, cups and bottles with few accidents.  Then we added pouring liquids into glasses and cups. 

The end result is a behavior we engage in daily and, with few exceptions, we don't spill a drop of what we are drinking.  There are numerous "links" in this chain leading to a specific behavior we learned "**backwards**".  We have learned the chain of reaching for a glass, picking it up and taking a drink and returning it to the counter or table.  We learned this chain backwards.  It is called a chain because it has behavior **"links"** also called **approximations**.  

Remember, as we learn new behavior, a link is as strong as its weakest "link".   Players who refer to themselves as scratch golfers on the range but not the course are well practiced "over the ball" but seldom integrate a full routine into their practice.  They hit ball after ball without walking behind the ball, finding a target, working on their alignment and walking into the shot and setting up before swinging.

We can learn most things when the **links** are broken into small enough learning segments or **approximations**.   It is important that the links be organized in separate behaviors that can be blended into a "Routine" with practice.

Teaching is "belief conversion".  If you provide your student with enough **Guided Discovery** they will be more compliant with their "homework".  Your long term goal is to make your students Visual and Independent.  When they practice and play. 

Our students expect to hit balls and work on swing mechanics during a lesson.  It is important that you provide them with that opportunity while building the foundation of their swing.  

The following practice schedule will help every student find consistency when they play.  Some of your students want it (success) **now** and they will not put in the practice as outlined.  Some will put in the practice and their learning will be accelerated.

Every level of Certification will be laid out using the Learning Model of **Backwards Chaining**.  We always start at the ball and work backwards.  There are distinct learning goals in each of the Certification levels.  Level one is about Stance Width and creating Core Symmetry.  You will note how your student puts their hands on the club and make a minor adjustment if necessary.  Grip & Posture are a separate levels of Certification.  I would suggest your students purchase a blue bar and bungee from the **Wright Balance Products**page if they are serious about home practice.  They will use it at every level of learning as immediate feedback.   The more immediate their feedback, the greater the opportunity for learning.

During the first lesson, place the alignment stick on the ground so your student can check their stance width.  If they understand the importance of that foundation, they will be compliant with home practice.  **Be Certain** to explain to your student that they should ***always look to their left at a target*** when they assume their stance width at the ball.  Tell your student if they look at their feet and set their stance width using the marked alignment stick, they won't be able to find their setup to the ball.   

In subsequent lessons, you want them to be able to find balance without the marked Stance Widths on the alignment stick.  Let them hit balls and intermittently place the alignment stick at their feet after you say:  "Get set but don't swing."  You and your student can gauge their progress and know exactly what to work on at home, away from the golf course.  This will also give you a measure of their compliance with home practice.

![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/6gVwwQy.jpg)

Some of your students will bypass some of these approximations and go right to setting up with a club, getting their grip and setting their posture.  Everyone of these setup conditions has the potential to open or close your student's hips.  Your students will learn best and advance faster if they practice and master each of the approximations before moving to the next level of practice.  Your better students will master each step quickly.  **Guided Discovery** as you proceed will embed the importance of starting with a good foundation.  

Experienced students have likely worked at length on positions in their swing.  Advise them that when they are set in a stable, balanced  foundation from Stance Width to Posture to Grip to Alignment, that sequencing of motion is really the only thing that is necessary to work on. 

Advise them to create an area at home away from the Golf Course or practice range where they can practice Stance Width.   

If your student is an experienced player they will already have a **Routine**.  [By the way, a **Routine** is simply a series of behavior links in a total chain.]  Watch your students Routine on the range and adjust their practice to include an alignment stick with their stance widths marked.  You may be able to make minimal changes in their **Routine**.  Although, most players have poor alignment to their target.  We will get to alignment in another Certification Level.  Your first goal is to get your player into a stance width from their Dominant Core Region that sets a solid base. 

 Advise them to practice as follows:
   
**Approximation 1**:  Stance Width practice with no Club 

1. Place the Stance Widths on their alignment or yardstick from their Dominant Core Region on the floor.
2. Set a ball on the floor in the middle of their feet.
3. Tell them to pick a target on a wall (light switch, corner of a picture frame, edge of a light fixture, etc).  
4.  Put their hands on their hips, **feet together**, look left and focus precisely on that target and spread their feet. 
5. When they have 90 to 100% success, they are ready for **Approximation 2**.

**Approximation 2**  Stance Width with a Club in the right hand

1.  Place the  club in the right hand with feet together.
2. Ground the club behind the ball
3. Set their eyes left on a precise target
4. Focus precisely on that target and spread their feet.
5. Check their feet to see if they have found their correct Stance Width and check the ball position.
6.  Advise them that the goal is not to be perfect the first few times.  The goal is to practice until they can find their Stance Width and ball position.

Suggest that they do this drill daily for 5 minutes.  Tell them when they have their next lesson that you will build their setup from these Stance Widths.  I would also suggest a narrower stance for an Upper Core Player and a wide stance for Lower Core Players.  Tell your students that Upper Core Players turn their hips in the backswing and a narrower stance facilitates that motion.  Lower Core players restrict their Lower Core in the backswing.  A wider stance base helps in this Lower Core restriction.  The Middle Core player is more neutral, a hybrid.  They restrict and then release their hips in the backswing and their stance width is between the Upper and Lower Core Player.   I will cover this "Sequencing of Motion" by Core Region in another Certification Level.
